<span class="subhead">A RECKONING WITH TIME</span></h2>

<blockquote class="b1">

<p class="center">&#8220;Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too
superstitious.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">To</span> say that superstition is one of the facts
of history is only to state a truism. If
that were all, we might treat the subject from a
purely philosophical or historical point of view,
as one of the inexplicable phenomena of an age
much lower in intelligence than our own, and
there leave it.</p>

<p>But if, also, we must admit superstition to be
a present, a living, fact, influencing, if not controlling,
the everyday acts of men, we have to
deal with a problem as yet unsolved, if not
insolvable.</p>

<p>I know it is commonly said that such things
belong to a past age&mdash;that they were the legitimate
product of ignorance, and have died out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
with the education of the masses. In other
words, we know more than our ancestors did
about the phenomena of nature, and therefore
by no means accept, as they did&mdash;good, superstitious
souls!&mdash;the appearance of a comet
blazing in the heavens, or the heaving of an
earthquake under our feet, as events having
moral significance. With the aid of electricity
or steam we perform miracles every day of our
lives, such as, no doubt, would have created
equal wonder and fear for the general stability
of the world not many generations ago.</p>

<p>Very true. So far as merely physical phenomena
are concerned, most of us may have
schooled ourselves to disunite them wholly from
coming events; but as regards those things
which spring from the inward consciousness of
the man himself, his intuitions, his perceptions,
his aspirations, his imaginative nature, which, if
strong enough, is capable of creating and peopling
a realm wholly outside of the little world
he lives in&mdash;&#8220;ay, there&#8217;s the rub.&#8221; Who will
undertake to span the gulf stretching out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
shoreless void between the revelations of science
and the incomprehensible mysteries of life itself?
It is upon that debatable ground that superstition
finds its strongest foothold, and, like the
ivy clinging round old walls, defies every attempt
to uproot it. As Hamlet so cogently
puts <span class="locked">it,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Superstition, we know, is much older than
recorded history, and we now stand on the
threshold of the twentieth century; yet just
in proportion as humanity has passed over this
enormous space of time, hand in hand with
progress, superstition has followed it like its
shadow. That shadow has not yet passed
away.</p>

<p>There is no sort of use in denying the proneness
of weak human nature to admit superstition.
It is an open door, through which the
marvellous finds easy access. Imbibed in the
cradle, it is not even buried in the grave. &#8220;Age
cannot stale, nor custom wither&#8221; those ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
fables of ghosts, giants, goblins, and brownies
told by fond mothers to children to-day, just
as they were told by mothers centuries ago.
Even the innocent looking Easter egg, which
continues to enjoy such unbounded popularity
with old and young, comes of an old Aryan
myth; while the hanging up of one&#8217;s stocking,
at Christmas, is neither more nor less than
an act of superstition, originating in another
myth; or, in plain English, no Santa Claus, no
stocking.</p>

<p>How much of childhood&#8217;s charm in the
greatest of all annual festivals, the world over,
would remain if Santa Claus, Kris Kringle,
and St. Nicholas were stripped of their traditional,
but wholly fictitious, character? One
of our popular magazines for children&mdash;long
life to it!&mdash;flourishes under the title of St.
Nicholas to-day; and during the very latest
observance of the time-honored festival, a leading
journal in New England&#8217;s chief city devoted
considerable space in its editorial columns to
an elaborate defence of that dear old myth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Santa Claus, with whom, indeed, we should
be very loth to part, if only for the sake of
old associations.</p>

<p>It is also noticed that quite recently stories
of the wonderful brownies have enjoyed their
greatest popularity. For a time these spindle-shanked,
goggle-eyed puppets could be seen
in every household, in picture-books, on book covers,
in the newspapers&mdash;in short, everywhere.
Should the children be told that there
never were any such creatures as fairies or
brownies, there would be an end to all the
charm they possess; for, unquestionably, their
only hold upon the popular mind rests upon
the association with olden superstition. Otherwise
they would be only so many commonplace
rag dolls.</p>

<p>Kipling&#8217;s popular &#8220;Jungle Stories,&#8221; probably
more widely read than any stories of the century,
give still further effect to the same idea.</p>

<p>Now, is not the plea that these are mere
harmless nothings by far the most short-sighted
one that could be advanced? The critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
thought to be impressed here is that about the
first teaching little children receive is a lesson in
superstition, and that, too, at a time when their
young minds are most susceptible to lasting impressions.
We have yet to hear of the mother,
nursery-maid, or governess, who begins the story
of Cinderella or Bluebeard with the warning
that it is not &#8220;a real true story,&#8221; as children say.</p>

<p>Are children of a larger growth any less
receptive to the marvellous? &#8220;Great oaks from
little acorns grow.&#8221; The seed first planted in
virgin soil later bears an abundant harvest.
Stage plays, operas, poetry, romances, painting,
and sculpture dealing with the supernatural
command quite as great a popularity, to-day,
as ever. Fortune telling, palmistry, astrology,
clairvoyance, hypnotism, and the rest, continue
to thrive either as a means of getting a living,
or of innocent diversion, leaving their mark
upon the inner consciousness just the same in
one case as in the other.</p>

<p>So much being undeniable, it stands with
every honest inquirer after truth to look these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
facts in the face without blinking. Ignorance
we dare not plead. The dictates of a sound
common sense will not permit us to dismiss
what we do not understand with a laugh, a
shrug, or a sneer. &#8220;To scold is not to answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Superstition is not easily defined. To say
that it is a disposition to believe more than is
warranted by reason, leaves us just as helpless
as ever; for where reason is impotent we have
nothing tangible left to fall back upon. There
is absolutely no support on which to rest that
lever. Religion and philosophy, which at first
fostered superstition, long ago turned against it
all the forces they possessed. Not even science
may hope to overthrow what can only be
reached through the inner consciousness of
man, because science can have little to do with
the spiritual side of man. That intangible
something still eludes its grasp. If all these
combined forces of civilization have so far signally
failed to eradicate superstition, so much
the worse for civilization.</p>

<p>We might also refer to the efforts of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
very erudite scholars to interpret modern superstition
by the aid of comparative mythology.
Vastly interesting, if not wholly convincing,
theories have been constructed on this line.
Instructive, too, is the fact that some of our
most familiar nursery stories may be traced to
the ancient folk-lore of still older peoples.
Even a remote antiquity is claimed for the
familiar nursery tale of &#8220;Jack and Jill&#8221;; while
something very similar to the story of &#8220;Little
Red Riding Hood&#8221; is found, in its purity, in the
grewsome werewolf folk-lore of Germany; and
&#8220;Jonah&#8217;s Gourd,&#8221; of the East, we are told,
probably is the original of &#8220;Jack and the Beanstalk&#8221;
of the West.</p>

<p>But the very fact of the survival of all these
hoary superstitions, some of them going back so
far that all further trace is lost, certainly furnishes
food for thought, since they seemingly
enjoy as great a popularity as ever.</p>

<p>Superstition being thus shown to be as old as
human history, the question naturally arises, not
how it may have originated in the Dark Ages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
but how it has kept its hold so tenaciously
throughout all the succeeding centuries down
to our own time.</p>

<p>Most peoples, barbarians even, believed in
some sort of a future state, in the principle of
good and evil, and of rewards and punishments.
There needs no argument then to account for
the insatiable longing to pry into futurity, and
to discover its hidden mysteries. The same
idea unsettled the minds of former generations,
nor can it be truthfully said to have disappeared
before the vaunted wisdom of this utilitarian
age. Like all forbidden fruit, this may be said
to be the subject of greatest anxiety to weak
human kind.</p>

<p>What then is this talisman with the aid of
which we strive to penetrate the secrets of the
world beyond us?</p>

<p>Man being what he is, only &#8220;a little lower
than the angels,&#8221; endowed with the supernatural
power of calling up at will mental images of
both the living and the dead, of building air-castles,
and peopling them according to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
fantasy, as well in Cathay as in Spain, of standing
by the side of an absent friend on the
summit of Mont Blanc, one moment among the
snows, the next flitting through the garden spots
of sunny Italy&mdash;if he is thus capable of transporting
himself into an enchanted land by the
mere exercise of the power of his imagination&mdash;what
could better serve him as a medium of
communication with the unknown, and what
shall deter him from seeking to fathom its
deepest mysteries? Napoleon said truly that
the imagination governs the universe. Every
one has painted his own picture of heaven and
hell as well as Dante or Milton, or the divine
mysteries as truly as Leonardo or Murillo.
Surely, the imagination could go no further.</p>

<p>Assuming this to be true, there is little need
to ask why, in this enlightened age, the attempt
should be made to revive vagaries already
decrepit, that would much better be allowed to
go out with the departed century, unhonored
and unsung. Such a question could proceed
only from a want of knowledge of the true facts
in the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
But whether superstition is justified by the
dictates of a sound common sense, is not so
material here, as whether it actually does exist;
and if so, to what extent. That is what we shall
try to make clear in the succeeding pages. The
inquiry grows interesting in many ways, but
most of all, we think, as showing the slow
stages by which the human mind has enfranchised
itself from a species of slavery, without
its counterpart in any direction to which we
may turn for help or guidance. Even science,
that great leveller of popular error, limps here.
Certainly, what has existed as long as human
history must be accepted as a more or less
active force in human affairs. We are not,
therefore, dealing with futilities.</p>

<p>Of the present status of superstition, the
most that can be truthfully said is that some of
its worst forms are nearly or quite extinct, some
are apparently on the wane, while those representing,
perhaps, the widest extremes (the most
puerile and the most vital), such, for example,
as relate to vapid tea-table gossip on the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
hand, and to fatal presentiments on the other,
continue quite as active as ever. Uncivilized
beings are now supposed to be the only ones
who still hold to the belief in witchcraft, although
within a very few months it has been
currently reported as a fact that the judge of
a certain Colorado court admitted the plea of
witchcraft to be set up, because, as this learned
judge shrewdly argued, more than half the
people there believed in it. The defendant,
who stood charged with committing a murderous
assault upon a woman, swore that she had
bewitched him, and was acquitted by the jury,
mainly upon his own testimony.</p>

<p>Unquestionably modern hypnotism comes
very close to solving the problem of olden
witchcraft, which so baffled the wisdom, as it
tormented the souls and bodies, of our ancestors,
with this difference: that, while witchcraft
was believed to be a power to work evil, coming
direct from his Satanic Majesty himself,
hypnotism is a power or gift residing in the
individual, like that of mesmerism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
But if it be true that there are very few
believers in witchcraft among enlightened beings
to-day, it cannot be denied that thousands
of highly civilized men and women as firmly
believe in some indefinable relation between
man and the spirit world as in their own
existence; while tens of thousands believe in
such a relation between mind and mind. Indeed,
the former class counts some very notable
persons among its converts. For example,
Camille Flammarion, the distinguished scientist,
positively declares that he has had direct communication
with hundreds of departed <span class="locked">spirits.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span>
And the Reverend M.&nbsp;J. Savage, pastor of the
Church of the Messiah, in New York, is reported
to have announced himself a convert to
spiritualism to his congregation not long ago.</p>

<p>The true explanation for all these different
beliefs must be sought for, we think, deep
down in the nature of man, which is much
the same to-day in its relation to the supernatural
world as it was in the days of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
fathers of bigoted memory. In reality, the
supernatural element exists to a greater or less
degree in all of us, and no merely human
agency can pretend to fix its limits.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, then, those beliefs which
have exerted so potent an influence in the past
over the minds or affairs of men, which continue
to exert such influence to-day, and, for
ought we know to the contrary, may extend
that influence indefinitely, are not to be whistled
down the wind, or kept hidden away under
lock and key, especially when we reflect that
the most terrible examples of the frailty of all
human judgments concerning these beliefs have
utterly failed to remove the groundwork upon
which they rest.</p>

<p>There still remains the sentimental side of
superstition to consider. What, for example,
would become of much of our best literature, if
all those apt and beautiful figures culled from
the rich stores of ancient mythology&mdash;the very
flowers of history, so to speak&mdash;were to be
weeded out of it with unsparing hand? What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
would Greek and Roman history be with their
gods and goddesses left out? With what loving
and appreciative art our greatest poets
have gathered up the scattered legends of the
fading past. Some one has cunningly said that
superstition is the poetry of life, and that of all
men poets should be superstitious.</p>

<p>As a matter of history, it is well known that
our Puritan ancestors came over here filled full
of the prevalent superstitions of the old country;
yet even they had waged uncompromising
warfare against all such ceremonious observances
as could be traced back to heathen
mythology. Thus, although they cut down
May-poles, they had too much reverence for
the Bible to refuse to believe in witches.
Writers like Mr. Hawthorne have supposed that
the wild and extravagant mysteries of their
savage neighbors, may, to some extent, have
become incorporated with their own beliefs.
However that may be, it is certain that the
Puritan fathers believed in no end of pregnant
omens, also in ghosts, apparitions, and witches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
as well as in a personal devil, with whom,
indeed, later on, they had no end of trouble. In
short, if anything happened out of the common,
the devil was in it. So say many to-day.</p>

<p>A certain amount of odium has attached
itself to the Puritan fathers of New England,
on this account, among unreflecting or ill-natured
critics at least, just as if, upon leaving
Old England, those people would be expected
to leave their superstitions behind them, like
so much useless luggage. As a matter of fact,
rank superstition was the common inheritance
of all peoples of that day and generation,
whether Jew or Gentile, Frenchman or Dutchman,
Virginian or New Englander. Of its
wide prevalence in Old England we find ample
proof ready to our hand. For example:</p>

<p>&#8220;At Boston, in Lincolnshire, Mr. Cotton
being their former minister, when he was
gone the bishop desired to have organs set
up in the church, but the parish was unwilling
to yield; but, however, the bishop prevailed
to be at the cost to set them up. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
they being newly up (not playing very often
with them) a violent storm came in at one
window and blew the organs to another window,
and brake both organs and window
down, and to this day the window is out of
reputation, being boarded and not glazed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Still further to show the feeling prevailing
in England toward superstition at the time of
the settlement of this country, in the historical
essay entitled &#8220;With the King at Oxford,&#8221;
we find this anecdote: The King (Charles I.),
coming into the Bodleian Library on a certain
day, was shown a very curious copy of
Virgil. Lord Falkland persuaded his Majesty
to make trial of his fortune by thrusting a
knife between the leaves, then opening the
book at the place in which the knife was inserted.
The king there read as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Yet let him vexed bee with arms and warres of people wilde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hunted out from place to place, an outlaw still exylde:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him go beg for helpe, and from his childe dissevered bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death and slaughter vile of all his kindred let him see.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The narrative goes on to say that the king&#8217;s
majesty was &#8220;much discomposed&#8221; by this uncanny
incident, and that Lord Falkland, in
order to turn the king&#8217;s thoughts away from
brooding over it, proposed making the trial
himself.</p>

<p>We continue to draw irrefragable testimony
to the truth of our position from the highest
personages in the realm. Again, according
to Wallington, Archbishop Laud, arch persecutor
of the Puritans, has this passage in his
diary: &#8220;That on such or such a day of the
month he was made archbishop of Canterbury,
and on that day, which was a great day
of honor to him, his coach and horses sunk
as they came over the ferry at Lambeth, in
the ferry-boat, and he prayed that this might
be no ill omen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our pious ancestors put a good deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
faith in so-called &#8220;judgments,&#8221; or direct manifestations
of the divine wrath toward evildoers,
as all readers of Mather&#8217;s &#8220;Remarkable
Providences&#8221; well know. But they were
by no means alone in such beliefs. It is related
of the poet Milton, after he became blind,
that the Duke of York (later James II.)
asked him if he did not consider the loss
of his eyesight as a judgment inflicted upon
him for what he had written of the late king.
In reply Milton asked the duke, if such afflictions
were to be regarded as judgments from
heaven, in what manner he would account for
the fate of the late king; ... he, the speaker,
had only lost his eye, while the king had lost
his head.&#8221;</p>

<p>John Josselyn, Gent., an Englishman, but no
Puritan, who spent some time in New England,
chiefly at Scarborough in Maine, published, in
1672, in England, a little book under the title of
&#8220;New England&#8217;s Rarities Discovered.&#8221; Some
things which Josselyn &#8220;discovered&#8221; would be rarities
indeed to this generation. For instance, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
describes the appearance of several prodigious
apparitions&mdash;all of which has a value in
enabling us properly to gauge the tone and
temper of popular feeling where the book was
written, and where it was published. One of
his &#8220;rarities&#8221; is worth repeating here, if only
for the pretty sentiment it embodies. He says
of the twittering chimney-swallows, &#8220;that when
about to migrate they commonly throw down
(the chimney) one of their young into the room
below, by way of gratitude,&#8221; presumably in
return for the hospitalities of the house. He
then goes on to say, &#8220;I have more than once
observed that, against the ruin of a family, these
birds will forsake the house and come no more.&#8221;
This comes from a more or less close observer,
who himself occupied the relation we desire to
establish, namely that of a transplanted Englishman,
so thoroughly grounded in old superstition
that all the marvels he relates are told with an
air of truth quite refreshing.</p>

<p>An amusing instance of how far prevalent
superstition can lead astray minds usually enlightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
is soberly set forth in Governor
Winthrop&#8217;s celebrated history. It is a fit corollary
to the organ superstition, just narrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Winthrop the younger, one of the magistrates,
having many books in a chamber,
where there was corn of divers sorts, had among
them one wherein the Greek Testament, the
Psalter and the Common Prayer were bound
together. He found the Common Prayer eaten
with mice, every leaf of it, and not any of the
two other touched, nor any other of his books,
though there were above a thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>All these superstitious beliefs were solemnly
bequeathed by the fathers to their children under
the sanction of a severe penal code, together
with all the accumulated traditions of their
own immediate ancestors. And in some form
or other, whether masquerading under some thin
disguise or foolish notion, superstition has continued
from that day to this. As Polonius says:</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;... &#8217;Tis true, &#8217;tis pity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pity &#8217;tis &#8217;tis true.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Although a great many popular beliefs may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
seem puerile in the extreme, they none the less
go to establish the fact to be kept in mind.
Since I began to look into the matter I have
been most astonished at the number of very
intelligent persons who take care to conform to
prevailing beliefs in things lucky or the reverse.
It is true Lord Bacon tells us that &#8220;in all superstitions
wise men follow fools.&#8221; But this blunt
declaration of his has undoubted reference to
the schoolmen, and to the monastic legends
which were such powerful aids in fostering the
growth of superstition as it existed long before
Bacon&#8217;s <span class="locked">time:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;A bone from a saintly anchorite&#8217;s cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vial of earth from a martyrs grave.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The class of persons just spoken of, is, however,
so keenly sensitive to ridicule that only
some chance remark betrays their real mental
attitude.</p>

<p>With the unlettered it is different. Superstition
is so much more prevalent among them
that less effort is made at concealment. Perhaps
the many agencies at work to put it down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
have not had so fair a trial in the country as in
the city. And yet the recent &#8220;Lucky-Box&#8221;
craze makes it difficult to draw the line. Be that
as it may, it would hardly be an exaggeration to
say that some rural communities in New England
are simply honeycombed with it. Indeed,
almost every insignificant happening is a sign
of something or other.</p>

<p>One result of my own observation in this
field of research is, that women, if not by
nature more superstitious than men, hold to
these old beliefs much more tenaciously than
men. In the country, it is the woman who is
ready to quarrel with you, if, in some unguarded
moment, you should venture to doubt
the potency of her manifold signs. In the city,
it is still the woman who presents her husband
with some charm or other to be worn on his
watch-chain, as a safeguard against disease,
inconstancy, late hours, or other uncounted
happenings of life, believing, as she does, more
or less implicitly, in its traditional efficacy. In
all that relates to marriage, too, women are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
usually most careful how they disregard any of
the accepted dicta on a subject of so much
concern to their future happiness, as will appear
later on.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago the poet Whittier declared
that &#8220;There is scarcely a superstition of the past
three centuries which has not, at this very time,
more or less hold upon individual minds among
us.&#8221; The broad declaration demands less qualification
to-day than is generally supposed.</p>

<p>Most of the examples collected in this volume
have come under my own observation;
some have been contributed by friends, many
by the newspapers. If their number should
prove a surprise to anybody, I can only say
that mine has fully equalled their own. But
let us, at least, be honest about it. We can
conceal nothing from ourselves. Silence may
be golden, but it makes no converts.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> trite saying that &#8220;children and fools
are soothsayers&#8221; goes straight to the
heart of those familiar superstitions with which
the folk-lore of childhood abounds. We, the
children of a larger growth, often call to mind
with what avidity we listened in our childhood&#8217;s
days to the nursery tales of giants, dwarfs,
ghosts, fairies, and the like creations of pure
fancy. We still remember how instantly all
the emotions of our childish nature were excited
by the recital of these marvels&mdash;told us,
too, with such an air of truth, that never for a
moment did we doubt them. Oh, how we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
hated Blue Beard, and how we adored Jack
the Giant-Killer! Are we not treated, just as
soon as we are out of the cradle, as if superstition
was the first law of nature? What is the
wonder, then, that the effects of these early
impressions are not easily got rid of, or the
impressions themselves soon, if ever, forgotten?

<p>Holding the pretty field buttercup under
another&#8217;s chin, in order to see if he or she loves
butter, is a good form of divination. So is the
practice of blowing off the fluffy dandelion top,
after the flower has gone to seed, to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the hour, as that flower always opens at about
five in the morning, and shuts at about eight in
the evening, thus making it stand in the room
of a clock for shepherds. This plant has also
been called the rustic oracle. To find the time
of day, as many puffs as it takes to blow away
the downy seed balls gives the answer. The
same method of divination is employed by
children to find out if their mothers want them;
or to waft a message to some loved one; or to
know if such or such a person is thinking of
them; and whether he or she lives north, east,
south, or west.</p>

<p>To the same general purport is the invocation:</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Rain, rain, go away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come again another day.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We understand that the equally familiar
<span class="locked">form,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Snail, snail, put out your horn,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">is repeated in China as well as in this country,
though sometimes altered to</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Snail, snail, come out of your hole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else I&#8217;ll beat you black as a coal.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One equally familiar form of childish invocation
appears in the pretty little lady-bird rhyme,
so often repeated by the <span class="locked">young:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Lady-bird, lady-bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly away home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your house is on fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your children will burn.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A favorite way, with boys, of choosing sides
for a game of ball is by measuring the stick.
To do this, the leader of one side first heaves
the stick in the air, skilfully catching it, as it
falls, at a point as near a hand&#8217;s-breadth to the
end as possible, as his opponent must then
measure the stick with him, alternately hand-over-hand,
from the point where it is caught.
The one securing enough of the last of the
stick for a hold, has the first choice. This is
determination by lot.</p>

<p>Still another form of invocation, formerly
much used to clinch a bargain between boys,
when &#8220;swapping&#8221; jack-knives or marbles, runs
to this <span class="locked">effect:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Chip, chop, chay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give a thing, give a thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never take it back again.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The process of counting a person out in the
familiar phrase as being &#8220;it,&#8221; is fairly traced
back to the ancient custom of designating a
criminal from among his fellows by lot. The
form that we know the best in New England,
a sort of barbaric doggerel, according to Mr.
Burton, is still current in Cornwall, England,
and goes in this <span class="locked">wise:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Ena, mena, bora, mi:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kisca, lara, mova, di:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eggs, butter, cheese, bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stick, stock, stone dead.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The resemblance between the foregoing, and
what is current among playfellows on this
side of the water easily suggests that the boys
of the &#8220;good Old Colony times,&#8221; so often
referred to with a sigh of regret, brought their
games and pastimes along with them. As
now remembered, the doggerel charm runs as
<span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Eny, meny, mony might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huska, lina, bony tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huldy, guldy, boo!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In getting ready for a game of &#8220;tag,&#8221; &#8220;I
spy,&#8221; or &#8220;hide and seek,&#8221; the one to whom
this last magic word falls becomes the victim or
is said to be &#8220;it.&#8221; So in like manner the
rhymed formula, following, is employed in
counting a child &#8220;out&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;One-ery, two-ery, ickery Ann,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fillicy, fallicy, Nicholas, John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queever, quaver, English knaver,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stinckelum, stanckelum, Jericho, buck.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A more simple counting-out rhyme is this:</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;One, two, three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out goes he (or she).&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Tit, tat, toe,&#8221; is still another form, repeated
with variations according to locality.</p>

<p>These few examples may serve to show
that what the performers themselves regard
only as a simple expedient in the arranging
of their games, if they ever give the matter
a thought, is really a survival of the belief
in the efficacy of certain magical words, turned
into rhyme, to propitiate success. If this idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
had not been instilled into our children by
long custom and habit, it is not believed that
they would continue to repeat such unmeaning
drivel. Yet, as childish as it may seem,
it advances us one step in solving the intricate
problem in hand; for here, too, &#8220;the
child is father to the man.&#8221;</p>

<span class="i0">&#8220;Fair is foul, and foul is fair.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Shakespeare.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">There</span> is a certain class of so-called
signs, that from long use have become
so embedded in the every-day life of the
people as to pass current with some as mere
whimsical fancies, with others as possessing
a real significance. At any rate, they crop
out everywhere in the course of common conversation.
Most of them have been handed
down from former generations, while not a
few exhale the strong aroma of the native
soil itself.</p>

<p>Of this class of familiar signs or omens,
affecting only the smaller and more casual
happenings one may encounter from day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
day, or from hour to hour, those only will be
noticed which seem based on actual superstition.
Many current weather proverbs accord
so exactly with the observations of science as
to exclude them from any such classification.
They are simply the homely records of a
simple folk, drawn from long experience of
nature in all her moods. As even the prophecies
of the Weather Bureau itself often fail
of fulfilment, it is not to be wondered at if
weather proverbs sometimes prove no better
guide, especially when we consider that &#8220;all
signs fail in a dry time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following are a few examples selected
from among some <span class="locked">hundreds:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>When a cat races playfully about the house,
it is a sign that the wind will rise.</p>

<p>It is a sign of rain if the cat washes her
head behind her ears; of bad weather when
Puss sits with her tail to the fire.</p>

<p>Spiders crawling on the wall denote rain.</p>

<p>If a dog is seen eating green grass it is a
sign of coming wet weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Hang up a snake skin for rain.</p>

<p>If the grass should be thickly dotted in the
morning with cobwebs of the ground spider,
glistening with dew, expect rain. Some say
it portends the exact opposite. This puts us
in mind of Cato&#8217;s quaint saying that &#8220;two
auguries cannot confront each other without
laughing.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the kettle should boil dry, it is a sure
sign of rain. Very earnestly said a certain
respectable, middle-aged housewife to me:
&#8220;Why, sir, sometimes you put twice as much
water in the kettle without its boiling away.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the cattle go under trees when the
weather looks threatening, there will be a
shower. If they continue feeding, it will probably
be a steady downpour.</p>

<p>A threatened storm will not begin, or the
wind go down, until the turning of the tide
to flood. Not only the people living along
shore, but all sailors believe this.</p>

<p>Closely related to the above is the belief
that a sick person will not die until ebb tide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
When that goes out, the life goes with it. I
have often heard this said in some seaports
in Maine.</p>

<p>These popular notions, concerning the influence
of the tides, be it said, have come down
to us from a remote antiquity. The Pythagorean
philosopher, indeed, stoutly affirmed that
the ebbing and flowing of the sea was nothing
less than the respiration of the world itself,
which was supposed to be a living monster,
alternately drawing in water, instead of air,
and heaving it out again.</p>

<p>Again, an old salt, who had perhaps heard
of Galileo&#8217;s theory, once tried to illustrate to
me the movement of the tides by comparing
it to that of a man turning over in bed, and
dragging the bedclothes with him, his notion
being that as the world turned round, the
waters of the ocean were acted upon in a like
manner.</p>

<p>To resume the <span class="locked">catalogue:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A bee was never caught in the rain&mdash;that
is, if the bee scents rain, it keeps near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
hive. If, on the contrary, it flies far, the day
will be fair. The ancients believed this industrious
little creature possessed of almost
human intelligence.</p>

<p>When the squirrels lay in a greater store of
nuts than usual, expect a cold winter.</p>

<p>If the November goose-bone be thick, so
will the winter weather be unusually severe.
This prediction appears as regularly as the
return of the seasons.</p>

<p>Many meteors falling presage much snow.</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">What it&#8217;s going to do.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There will be as many snow-storms in a
winter as there are days remaining in the
month after the first fall of snow.</p>

<p>Children are told, of the falling snow, that
the old woman, up in the sky, is shaking her
feather-bed.</p>

<p>High tides on the coast of Maine are considered
a sign of rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
When the muskrat builds his nest higher
than usual, it is a sign of a wet spring, as this
means high water in the ponds and streams.</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;A winter fog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will kill a dog,&#8221;<br /></span>

<p class="in0">which is as much as to say that a thaw, with
its usual accompaniments of fog and rain, is
invariably productive of much sickness.</p>

<p>Winter thunder is to old folks death, and
to young folks plunder.</p>

<p>Do business with men when the wind is

I know a hawk from a handsaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was certainly a pretty conceit, no
matter if it has been lost sight of, that the
sun always dances upon Easter morning.</p>

<p>One of the oldest of weather rhymes runs
in this <span class="locked">wise:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">

<p>Science having finally accepted what vulgar
philosophy so long maintained, namely that
the moon exerts an undoubted influence upon
the tides of the sea, all the various popular
beliefs concerning her influence upon the
weather that have been wafted to us over,
we know not how many centuries, find ready
credence. If the mysterious luminary could
perform one miracle, why not others? Thus
reasoned the ignorant multitude.</p>

<p>The popular fallacy that the moon is made
of &#8220;greene cheese,&#8221; as sung by Heywood, and
repeated by that mad wag Butler, in &#8220;Hudibras,&#8221;
may be considered obsolete, we suppose, but in
our youth we have often heard this said, and,
it is to be feared, half believed it.</p>

<p>Cutting the hair on the waxing of the moon,
under the delusion that it will then grow
better, is another such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
As preposterous as it may seem, our worthy
ancestors, or some of them at least, firmly
believed that the Man in the Moon was veritable
flesh and blood.</p>

<p>In &#8220;Curious Myths,&#8221; Mr. Baring-Gould refers
the genesis of this belief to the Book of
<span class="locked">Numbers.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span></p>

<p>An old Scotch rhyme runs <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;A Saturday&#8217;s change and a Sunday&#8217;s prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was nivver gude mune in nae man&#8217;s time.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the horns of the new moon are but
slightly tipped downward, moderate rains may
be looked for; if much tipped, expect a downpour.
On the other hand, if the horns are
evenly balanced, it is a sure sign of dry
weather. Some one says in &#8220;Adam Bede,&#8221;
&#8220;There&#8217;s no likelihood of a drop now an&#8217; the
moon lies like a boat there.&#8221; The popular
notion throughout New England is that when
the new moon is turned downward, it cannot
hold water. Hence the familiar sayings of a
wet or a dry moon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>
<p>If the Stormy Petrel (Mother Cary&#8217;s Chicken)
is seen following in the wake of a ship at sea,
all sailors know that a storm is brewing, and
that it is time to make all snug on board. As
touching this superstition, I find the following
entry in the Rev. Richard Mather&#8217;s <cite>Journal</cite>:
&#8220;This day, and two days before, we saw
following ye ship a little bird, like a swallow,
called a Petterill, which they say doth follow
ships against foule weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore, in honest Jack&#8217;s eyes, to shoot
one of these little wanderers of the deep, not
only would invite calamity, but would instantly
bring down a storm of indignation on the
offender&#8217;s head. And why, indeed, should
this state of mind in poor Jack be wondered
at, when he hears so much about kraaken,
mermaids, sea-serpents, and the like chimera,
and when those who walk the quarter-deck
readily lend themselves to the fostering of his
delusions?</p>

<p>A mare&#8217;s tail in the morning is another
sure presage of foul weather. This consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
in a long, low-hanging streak of murky vapor,
stretching across a wide space in the heavens,
and looking for all the world like the trailing
smoke of some ocean steamer, as is sometimes
seen long before the steamer heaves
in sight. The mare&#8217;s tail is really the black
signal of the advancing storm, drawn with
a smutty hand across the fair face of the
heavens. Hence the <span class="locked">legend,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Mackerel sky and mare&#8217;s tails<br /></span>

<p>If the hedgehog comes out of his hole on
Candlemas <span class="locked">Day,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> and sees his shadow, he
goes back to sleep again, knowing that the
winter is only half over. Hence the familiar
<span class="locked">prediction:&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>
<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;If Candlemas day is fair and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&#8217;ll be two winters in the year.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The same thing is said of the bear, in Germany,
as of the hedgehog or woodchuck.</p>

<p>The Germans say that the badger peeps
out of his hole on Candlemas Day, and if he
finds snow on the ground, he walks abroad;
but if the sun is shining, he draws back into
his hole again. At any rate, the habits of
this predatory little beast are considered next
to infallible by most country-folk in New
England.</p>

<p>A similar prediction carries this form: On
Candlemas Day just so far as the sun shines
in, just so far will the snow blow in.</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;As far as the sun shines in on Candlemas Day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far will the snow blow in before May:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As far as the snow blows in on Candlemas Day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far will the sun shine in before May.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From these time-honored prophecies is deduced
the familiar <span class="locked">warning:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">

<p>An old Californian predicted a dry season
for the year 1899, because he had noticed
that the rattlesnakes would not bite of late,
a never failing sign of drought which few,
we fancy, would feel inclined to put to the
test.</p>

<p>An unusually cold winter is indicated by
the greater thickness of apple skins, corn
husks, and the like.</p>

<p>The direction from which the wind is blowing
usually indicates what the weather will
be for the day,&mdash;wet or dry, hot or cold,&mdash;but
here is a rhymed prediction which puts all
such prophecies to <span class="locked">shame:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;The West wind always brings wet weather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The East wind wet and cold together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The South wind surely brings us rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The North wind blows it back again.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If the sun in red should set,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The next day surely will be wet;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If the sun should set in gray,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The next will be a rainy day.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This falls more strictly in line with many
of the so-called signs which, like the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
woman&#8217;s indigo, if good would either sink
or swim, she really didn&#8217;t know which; or
like the predictions of the old almanac makers,
who so shrewdly foretold rain in April, and
snow in December.</p>

sickly autumn, which is the same thing as saying
that unseasonable weather is pretty sure to
be unwholesome weather. The same prediction
is expressed by the old saying that &#8220;A green
Christmas makes a fat church-yard.&#8221; Both predictions
agree with the observations of medical
science.</p>

<p>A spoon in the saucer and another in the cup

<p>A tea-stem floating in the tea-cup&mdash;a common

<p>Whistling to keep one&#8217;s courage up, or for

so until some more satisfactory explanation is

<span class="subhead">CHARMS TO GOOD LUCK</span></h2>

<div class="center-container b1"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Of</span> the things closely associated in the
popular mind with good or bad luck,
what in short one may or may not do to obtain
the favors or turn aside the frowns of fortune,
the list is a long one. We say &#8220;God bless
me!&#8221; when we sneeze, as an invocation to
good luck. Then, for instance, it is considered
lucky to find a cast-off horseshoe, or a four-leaved
clover, or to see the new moon over
the right shoulder, or to have a black cat in
the house, especially one that comes to you
of its own accord. Then there also is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
lucky pocket-piece, which the owner will seldom
part with, although I once heard a man
loudly lamenting that he had &#8220;sold his luck&#8221;
by doing so. There also is the lucky-bone
of a <span class="locked">haddock,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> the wishing-bone of a chicken,
the lucky base-ball bat, and, what is still more
strange, the lucky spider, if one happens to be
found on one&#8217;s clothes,&mdash;though this will hardly
prevent, we imagine, all womankind from
screaming out to the nearest person to come
and brush off the hateful little creature. Many
will not kill a spider on account of this belief,
which is supposed to be derived from the
romantic story of King Robert Bruce and the
spider.</p>

<p>The familiar saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s luck in odd
numbers,&#8221; lingers in song and story. Does
not Rory O&#8217;More say so? Odd numbers or
combinations of odd numbers are almost invariably
chosen in buying lottery tickets. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
they have received the highest official
sanction for a very long time. In the
&#8220;Art of Navigation,&#8221; printed in the year
1705, the following rule is laid down for
firing salutes by ships of the royal navy: &#8220;to
salute with an odd number of guns, the which
are to be answered with fit correspondency.
And the number of odd guns is so punctually
observed, that whenever they are given <i>even</i>
&#8217;tis received for an infallible sign that either
the captain or some noted officer is dead in
the voyage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The above rule or custom has held good to
this day. In the United States the prescribed
salute to the President is twenty-one guns;
seventeen to the Vice-President, and so on in
descending scale, according to rank, in the
several branches of the civil, military, and
naval service. Medicines are often taken an
odd number of times, though not invariably,
as they once were. A hen is always set on
an odd number of eggs, although I could
never find any one who could give any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
reason than custom for it. What Biddy does
when she &#8220;steals her own nest&#8221; is not ascertained.</p>

<p>It appears from such data as we have been
able to gather that the number Three and its
multiple Nine were formerly held to be indispensable
to the successful working of the
magician&#8217;s arts. In &#8220;Macbeth,&#8221; the weird
sisters mutter the dark <span class="locked">incantation:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice again to make up nine!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace!&mdash;the charm&#8217;s wound up.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And yet again, when concocting their
charmed hell-broth, while awaiting the coming
of the ambitious thane to learn his fate
of them, the mystic rite begins by declaring
the omens <span class="locked">propitious:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;1 <i>Witch</i>. Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">2 <i>Witch</i>. Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With the Romans, three handfuls of salt cast
over a dead body had all the virtues of a funeral.
Pirates were formerly hung at low-water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
mark and left hanging there until three tides
had overflowed them. Shakespeare makes Falstaff
say: &#8220;This is the third time; I hope good
luck lies in odd numbers.&#8221; Even now, the cabalistic
phrase &#8220;third time never fails,&#8221; prompts
the twice unsuccessful candidate for fortune&#8217;s
favors to renewed and more vigorous effort. In
short, there seems to be no end to the virtues
inherent in odd numbers.</p>

<p>But as all rules have their exceptions, so with
this prophetic rule of three, the fates would
seem to have ordained that it might be made
to work both ways. Simply by keeping one&#8217;s
eyes and ears open one sees and hears many
things. An enterprising news-gatherer jots down
a bit of superstition touching the fateful side of
the rule in question that came to him in this
easy sort of way: &#8220;I heard,&#8221; he says, &#8220;a most
sensible person, the other day, exclaim because
Queen Victoria had been obliged twice to postpone
her trip to the south of France, once on
account of the unsettled state of affairs over
there, and again because of the unsettled state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
of the weather. &#8216;The third time will be fatal
to her,&#8217; added this cheerful individual; &#8216;you
just mark my words.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It is nevertheless true, however, that the cabalistic
number Thirteen stands quite alone, so
far as we are informed, as the sombre herald of
misfortune. But here, as elsewhere, the exception
only goes to prove the rule.</p>

<p>A gentleman holding a lucrative office under
the government once told me that two of his
clerks wore iron finger rings, because they were
supposed to be lucky. It is a matter of general
knowledge that certain gems or precious
stones are worn on scarf-pins, watch-chains, finger
rings, or other articles of personal adornment
solely on account of the prevailing belief
in their efficacy to ward off sickness or disease,
prevent accidents, keep one&#8217;s friends,&mdash;in short,
to bring the wearer good luck. This branch of
the subject will be more fully treated of presently.</p>

<p>More unaccountable still is the practice of
wearing or carrying about on one&#8217;s person a
rabbit&#8217;s foot as a talisman, that timid little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
animal always having been intimately associated
with the arts of the magician and sorcerer.
But it must always be bunny&#8217;s hind foot. The
insatiate passion for novelty, we understand,
has now installed a turkey&#8217;s claw in the room of
the rabbit&#8217;s foot, to some extent, showing that
even credulity itself is the obedient slave of
fashion. Of course neither the rabbit&#8217;s foot
nor turkey&#8217;s claw is worn in its natural rough
state, but under the jeweller&#8217;s skilful hands,
tipped with gold or silver and set with the
wearer&#8217;s favorite gem (topaz, amethyst, or
whatever it may be), the charm, or mascot,
becomes an ornament to be worn, either suspended
from the neck, the wrist, or belt, or as
a clasp for the cape. The practice of wearing
a <span class="locked">caul,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> or an amulet blessed by the priest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
clearly denotes that here rich and poor meet on
common ground. It is not proposed, however,
to treat of those beliefs which may be directly
traced to the teachings of a particular church,
or that have become so embedded in the faith it
inculcates as to be an inseparable part of it
The Protestant world, or that part of it we live
in, is intrenched in no such stronghold.</p>

<p>To continue the <span class="locked">catalogue:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A black cat, without a single white hair, is a
witch of the sort that brings luck to the house.
Keeping one also insures to unmarried females
of the family plenty of sweethearts.</p>

<p>A branch of the mountain ash kept in the
house, or hung out over the door, will keep the
witches out.</p>

<p>Good luck is frequently crystallized in certain
uncouth but expressive sayings, such, for example,
as &#8220;nigger luck,&#8221; &#8220;lucky strike,&#8221; or
&#8220;Cunard luck,&#8221; referring to the remarkable
exemption of a certain transatlantic steamship
company from loss of life by disasters to its
ships. This particular saying has been quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
frequently heard of late in consequence of the
really providential escape of the steamship
<i class="ship">Pavonia</i>, of that line, from shipwreck, while on
her voyage from Liverpool to Boston. What
was uppermost in the minds of some of the
passengers and crew may easily be inferred
from the following extract, with which a relation
of the good ship&#8217;s fortunate escape from
foundering <span class="locked">concludes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The change of the moon passed at 9.30 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>,
and the light breeze changed at almost the same
moment. The gulls were sitting on the water,
which was a sign of luck, according to the
sailors. Then we discovered a lot of &#8216;Mother
Carey&#8217;s chickens&#8217; near the ship, which was also
a lucky omen, so we felt that Friday was to be
our lucky day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unquestionably, the horseshoe is the favorite
symbol of good luck the world over. You will
seldom see a man so much in a hurry that he
will not stop to pick one up. Although the
iron of which the shoe is fashioned is no longer
endowed with magic power, as it once was, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
sooner has it been beaten by the smith into the
form of a shoe than, <i>presto</i>, it becomes a power
to conjure with. Popular <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dictum</i> even prescribes
that the shoe must be placed with the prongs upward
or its virtue will be lost. It must, moreover,
be a cast-off shoe or the charm will not work.</p>

<p>The luck of the horseshoe has become proverbial.
We are now dealing with facts of
common knowledge. Indeed, we do not see
how any form of superstition could be more
fully or more freely recognized in the everyday
affairs of life. Even those who scout the superstition
itself, as a thing unworthy of serious
attention, do not hesitate to avail themselves of
its popularity for their own ends, thus giving it
a still wider currency. In short, this hoary
superstition is thriftily turned to account by
every imaginable device to tickle the fancy or
to turn a penny, although in being thus employed
it has quite cut loose from its ancient
traditions.</p>

<p>Thus it is that we now see the horseshoe
stamped on monograms, on Christmas cards, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
book covers, or even used in the title of a book,
most effectively, as in the case of &#8220;Horseshoe
Robinson.&#8221; It also is seen worked into floral
designs to be hung above the bride&#8217;s head, at a
wedding, or reverently laid upon the last resting-place
of the dead. Surely superstition could go
no farther.</p>

<p>The horseshoe has also come to be a favorite
trade-mark with manufacturers and dealers in all
sorts of wares. It is elaborately worked up in
gold and silver charms for those who would
rather be lucky than not, regardless of the
original <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dictum</i> that, to be serviceable, the shoe
must be made of iron and nothing else. There
lies before me, as I write this, the advertisement
of a certain farrier, who rests his plea for custom
upon the fact that as horseshoes bring luck to
the purchaser, therefore every horse should be
shod with his shoes. A certain horseshoers&#8217;
union attributes its victory over the employers,
in the matter of shorter hours, to the efficacy of
its trade symbol. And not long ago the fortunate
escape of Boston from a disastrous conflagration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
was heralded in a daily paper with a cut of a
horseshoe prefixed to the account.</p>

<p>Of late years, too, the horseshoe has grown
to be a favorite symbol in the house,&mdash;a sort
of household fetich, as it were,&mdash;if not because
of any faith in its traditional ability to bring
good luck, one is at loss to know why a
piece of old iron should be so conspicuously
hung up in the houses of rich and poor
alike.</p>

<p>The horseshoe was always, also, the favorite
emblem of the tavern and inn, in all countries.
Such signs as the &#8220;Three Horseshoes,&#8221; once
swung in Boston streets. In Samuel Sewall&#8217;s
Diary we find the following entry: &#8220;Sanctifie
to me ye deth of old Mrs. Glover who kept
the 3 horseshoes, and who dyed ye last
night.&#8221; Sewall, who lived in the immediate
neighborhood, leaves us in the dark as to
whether he mourned most for Mrs. Glover or
her exhilarating mixtures.</p>

<p>Returning to its proper place in folk-lore,
I myself have seen the horseshoe nailed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
the bowsprit of a vessel, over house and barn
doors, and even to bedsteads. In the country,
its supposed virtues continue to hold much of
their old sway, while among sailors a belief
in them has suffered little, if any, loss since
the day of Nelson and of the <i class="ship">Victory</i>.
On some very old country house, as old as
the witchcraft times, one can still see the
shape of a horseshoe wrought in the brickwork
of the chimneys, as well as one nailed
above the door, thus cleverly closing every
avenue against the entrance of witches. But
of all the odd caprices connected with the
use of the horseshoe, that related of Samuel
Dexter, of Boston, must carry off the palm
for oddity. He, being dissatisfied with his
minister, Dr. Codman, nailed a horseshoe to
his pew door, and then nailed up the pew
itself.</p>

<p>The origin of this remarkable superstition
is involved in the obscurity of past ages. It
is usually attributed to the virtue of cold iron
to keep witches out, through their inability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
step over it, and is probably allied to that
other superstition about the driving of iron
nails into the walls of Roman houses, with a
like object. Beyond that point its meaning
grows more and more obscure. The conjunction,
so essential to perfect the charm,
between iron in any form and the horse, is
said to have come from the magical properties
attributed to the animal by the ancients,
in whose mythology the horse always plays
an important part. King Richard, on Bosworth
field, offers his kingdom for a horse,
and Poor Richard, in his Almanac, tells us
how a man lost his life for want of a nail
in his horse&#8217;s shoe. Butler, from whose pen
figures of speech gush forth like water from
a never-failing spring, declares that evil spirits
are chased away by dint</p>

Turning now from the merely passive to
the active agency on the part of the seeker
after fortune&#8217;s favors, we enter upon a no less
marvellous, but vastly more attractive, field.
Here is something that is tried every <span class="locked">day:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Of two persons breaking apart the wishing-bone
of a chicken before forming a wish, the
one getting the longer piece is assured of the
fulfilment of his or her wish; the shorter
piece bodes disappointment.</p>

<p>Another way to test fickle fortune is to form
a wish while a meteor is falling; if one can do
so the desire will be gratified. This saying
would be no bad symbol of the importance of
seizing a golden opportunity ere it has escaped
us. As the immortal Shakespeare <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If a load of hay goes by, make a wish on it
and your wish will be gratified, provided you
instantly look another way. But the charm

should look back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
To see the new moon with the old in her
arms, a much more common thing by the way
in this country than in England, is considered
lucky; as runs an old <span class="locked">couplet:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Late, late yestreen, I saw the new moone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wi&#8217; the auld moone in hir armes.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here is another instance wherein the auguries
differ. An old sea-rhyme founded on the
same thing adds this <span class="locked">prediction:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;And if we gang to sea, master,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear we&#8217;ll come to harm.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is also accounted good luck to see the new
moon over the right shoulder, especially if you
instantly feel in your pocket and find money
there, as your luck thereby will be prodigiously
increased, but you must take care instantly to
turn the money over in your pocket.</p>

<p>Burglars are said to carry a piece of coal, or
some other object, about with them for luck.</p>

<p>Upon getting out of bed in the morning,
always put the right foot foremost. Slightly
altered, this injunction has been turned into
the familiar saying: &#8220;Put your best foot foremost.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Dr. Johnson was so particular about
this rule, that if he happened to plant his left
foot on the threshold of a house, he would turn
back, and reënter right foot foremost. Similarly,
one must always begin dressing the right
foot first. An exception occurs to us: in military
tactics it is always the left foot that goes
foremost.</p>

<p>Professional gamblers are firm believers in
the element of luck, the world over. According
to their <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dictum</i>, a youth who has never
gambled before, is sure to be lucky at his first
essay at play. Finding a piece of money or
carrying a dice in the pocket also insures good
fortune, they say.</p>

<p>To secure luck at cards or to change your
luck, when it is going against you, you must
walk three times around your chair or else
blow upon the cards with your breath. Beyond
reasonable doubt you will be a winner. Not so
very long ago, it was the custom for women to
offer to sit cross-legged in order to procure luck
at cards for their friends. I have seen players<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
spit on their hands for the same purpose. Sitting
cross-legged, with the fingers interlaced,
was formerly considered the correct magical
posture.</p>

<p>The hair will grow better if cut on the
waxing of the moon. This notion is probably
based on the symbolism of the moon&#8217;s waxing
and waning, as associated with growing and
declining nature.</p>

<p>A Newfoundland fisherman to-day spits on
the first piece of silver given him for luck. In
the Old Country this was also a common practice
among the lower class of hucksters, upon
receiving the price of the first goods sold on
that day, which they call &#8220;hansell.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Boxers
often spit into their hands before engaging in
a set-to, as also did the schoolboys of my own
age, who thought it a charm to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
master&#8217;s ferule from hurting them as much as
it otherwise would, but later found out their
mistake.</p>

<p>In some country districts the belief still holds
that if a live frog can be passed through a sick
cow the animal will get well, but the frog must
be alive and kicking, or the charm will not
work.</p>

<p>Salt was formerly the first thing taken into
a new house, in the belief that the occupants
would never want for bread in that house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happy is the corpse that the rain rains on.&#8221;
This is a sort of corollary to the belief, that it is
a fortunate sign if the sun shines on a newly
wedded couple.</p>

<p>The long established custom of laying the
head of the dead to the east is probably a survival
of the ancient sun-worship. It is traced
back to the Ph&#339;nicians. In Shakespeare&#8217;s
&#8220;Cymbeline&#8221; we find this reference to <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;We must lay his head to the east:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father hath reason for&#8217;t.&#8221;<br /></span>

<p>We are reminded that ropes are coiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
cranks turned, and eggs beaten with the sun.
One writer upon <span class="locked">Folk-lore<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> remarks that
passing the bottle at table from right to left,
instead of being merely proper form, really
comes from this ancient superstition.</p>

<p>Telling the bees of a death in the family was
formerly a quite general practice, if indeed it
has entirely died out. I know that it has been
practised in New England within my own
recollection. It was the belief that a failure to
so inform the bees would lead to their dwindling
away and dying, according to some interpreters,
or to their flying away, according to
others. The manner of proceeding was to
knock with the house-key three times against
the hives, at the same time telling the noisy
inmates that their master or mistress, as the
case might be, was dead. One case is reported
where an old man actually sung a psalm in
front of some hives. In New England the
hives were sometimes draped in black. The
semi-sacred character with which antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
invested this wonderful little insect sufficiently
accounts for the practice. Mr. Whittier has
some verses about it in &#8220;Home Ballads.&#8221;
Beating upon a pot or kettle when bees are
swarming comes from Virgil&#8217;s injunction, in the
like case, to raise tinkling sounds.</p>

<p>Laying a plate for a dead person was in pursuance
of the belief that, if it were omitted, one
death in the family would speedily be followed
by another.</p>

<p>The Passing Bell was originally instituted to
drive away evil spirits, as well as to bespeak
the prayers of all good Christians for a soul
just leaving the body. Sitting up with a dead
body originated in a like purpose. The former
custom is dimly reflected in the tolling of the
bell, the number of strokes indicating the age
of the deceased.</p>

<p>It is considered lucky to put on a garment
wrong side out. I knew of a sea-captain who,
on rising late in the morning of the day he was
to sail, in his hurry, put on his drawers wrong
side out. He said to his wife, with a laugh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
that he would wear them so for luck. The
ship in which he sailed was lost, with all on
board, on the very same night; and, as it turned
out, the captain&#8217;s mistake in putting on his
clothes proved the means of identifying his
mutilated remains when they were found on
the beach the next morning.</p>

<p>The trial to discover a witch, made use of
by the circle of hysterical young girls in the
time of the lamentable witchcraft terror, was to
take a sieve and a pair of scissors or shears,
stick the points of the shears in the wood of
the sieve, and let two of them hold it balanced
upright on the tips of their two fingers; then
to ask St. Peter and St. Paul if a certain
person, naming the one suspected, was a witch.
If the right one was hit upon, the sieve would
suddenly turn round.</p>

<p>As usual, Butler has something to say of this
<span class="locked">charm:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Th&#8217; oracle of the sieve and shears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That turns as certain as the spheres.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another similar charm is that of the Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and key. I do not learn of its being practised
of late, though it has been put to the trial since
I can remember, to discover a thief. It is done
in this way. The key is placed upon a certain
chapter in the Bible, after which the sacred
book is shut and tightly fastened. Both are
then hung to a nail. The name of the suspected
person is then repeated three times by
some one present, while another <span class="locked">recites:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;If it turns to thee, thou art the thief.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Should the key have turned, the guilt is, of
course, fixed upon the real criminal.</p>

<p>Perhaps the manner of proceeding in such
cases will be made clearer by the following
relation of an actual test and its results, which
took place in England some thirty years ago,
and was given to the world as a curious instance
of the degree of superstition then still
existing in many parts of Great Britain. The
account goes on to say that: &#8220;At the Cricklade
Petty Sessions, in Wiltshire, a matron named
Eliza Glass made a statement which was briefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
as follows: Her father had lost or missed the
sum of four pounds sterling, and suspicion,
apparently unfounded, fell upon herself and
her husband. The theory was formed that
she had stolen a key, and thus her husband
had obtained access to the money. It was
determined to test the matter by the &#8216;Bible
and key.&#8217; The key was placed in the
Bible on a particular place in Solomon&#8217;s
Song, the book closed and tied, and suspended
by a string passed through the handle
of the key, which protruded. One of the persons
then thought of the suspected individual,
the edge of the book turned toward the tester,
and Mrs. Glass was adjudged guilty, or as she
expressed it, &#8216;upset.&#8217; All this was in her
absence. But she knew that she was innocent,
and when informed of her condemnation
adopted tactics which others, more astute than
she, had used before her; she determined to
impeach the credibility of the witness. Taking
a New Testament she put the key on the
words &#8216;Blessed are the pure in heart,&#8217; and suspending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the book as before, she was acquitted.
Troubled by the apparent inconsistency of the
Old and the New Testaments, she inquired of
the magistrates what was to be done. They
dismissed her with the remark that the bench
could not interfere, and that, if innocent, she
ought to be satisfied with the approval of a
good conscience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thrusting a knife between the leaves of a
Bible to obtain a name for a child has not
gone out of use even yet.</p>

<p>The Wassail, or Loving Cup, is nothing but
a relic of superstition, like drinking of healths,
which custom, though no longer an indispensable
ceremonial on state occasions, as it has been
within the century, lives yet in the spirit whenever
two friends happen to pledge each other
in a social glass, silently or otherwise. The
familiar &#8220;Here&#8217;s to you!&#8221; is neither more nor
less than an invocation to good luck.</p>

<p>Throwing an old shoe is perhaps most intimately
associated, in the popular mind, with
marriage ceremonies; but it is also found doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
duty in other matters concerning personal advantage
or welfare,&mdash;as when, for instance, a
person was going out to transact business, it
was considered lucky to throw an old shoe
after him. The same thing was done when
servants were seeking or entering upon situations.
So far, the meaning of the act is simple
enough, the controlling idea being to propitiate
success.</p>

<p>But if we should divest an old shoe of its
assumed mystical property, in the name of that
superior wisdom which our cultured class is
supposed to possess, why would it not be as
well, or even better, to throw a new pair after
the candidate for good fortune? But no, it must
be an <i>old</i> shoe. And therein lies the whole
philosophy of the matter. Unless we shall
conform to the strict letter of this antiquated
custom, there will be no luck about the <span class="locked">house.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span></p>

<p>In Ben Jonson&#8217;s &#8220;Masque of Gypsies,&#8221; we
find this joyous <span class="locked">couplet:&mdash;</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Hurle after an old shoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&#8217;ll be merry whate&#8217;er I do.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Much to the same purport is Tennyson&#8217;s:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;And wheresoe&#8217;er thou move, good luck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall throw her old shoe after.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Apropos of beliefs affecting tradespeople of
to-day, a newspaper clipping notes the following
curious custom prevailing among the street
pedlers and small storekeepers of New York,
that has its origin with the Russian Jews.
In Baxter Street the clothing men and in
Division Street the milliners insist that a sale
must be made before nine o&#8217;clock on Monday
morning. No matter what the price and
regardless of profit or loss, some piece of
goods must be turned into coin by that hour;
otherwise the week will prove an unlucky one.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is a firm belief in
some parts of New England that if you pay
a bill on Monday, you will pay out money all
the rest of the week. Hence, a very natural
prejudice has arisen against paying a bill on
that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Shipmasters are admittedly very superstitious
folk. I once knew of a ship being named for
a certain well-known cotton mill, because the
said mill had always proved a lucky investment
to its owners. Another instance came to my
knowledge where a master, himself part owner,
consulted a clairvoyant about naming his new
ship. When the applicant timidly suggested
the name of <i>Pocahontas</i>, it was promptly rejected
with the remark: &#8220;She was nothing but
an old Indian woman. What do you want to
name your vessel after her for? Call her the
<i class="ship">Eagle Wing</i>.&#8221; And <i class="ship">Eagle Wing</i> it was.</p>

<p>By way of reënforcing beliefs of this particular
kind, we find a newspaper writer saying, it
is supposed in all sincerity, as otherwise his
offence would be unpardonable: &#8220;Don&#8217;t let
us call any of the new ships for Uncle Sam&#8217;s
navy after the state of Maine. For my part,
nothing would induce me to go aboard a new
<i class="ship">Maine</i> or a new <i class="ship">Portland</i>. Like that watch
of Captain Sigsbee, which has gone down into
the ocean three times, the last plunge being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
caused by the explosion of the <i class="ship">Maine</i>, a superstitious
person would prefer to be left at home.&#8221;
Whether or not the navy bureau shall listen to
this plea, and change the name proposed for
one of the new battle-ships, we fear that an
ineffaceable stigma will hereafter rest upon
these two names in the minds not alone of
seafaring folk, but of the whole generation
to whom the twin horrors which these names
recall are so familiar.</p>

<p>Still speaking of ships, I suppose few people
are aware that until quite recently it was the
custom, when a new ship was being built, to
put a piece of money, silver or gold, under
the heel of each mast. This custom at once
recalls that traditional one of putting coins
under the corner-stone of a new building; but
unlike that, the former act was in full accord
with the prevalent notion that it would bring
good luck to the vessel.</p>

<p>I find that some people are strongly impressed
with the idea that the month or day
on which they were born will prove to them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
most critical one throughout their whole lives.
Indeed, many strange coincidences of this sort
have come to my notice. If a man has happened
to have a run of bad luck, he will often
tell you that it is because he was born under an
unlucky star; if, on the other hand, he has
been unusually prosperous, it is commonly said
of him that he was born to good luck. So wags
the world!</p>

<p>As a fitting pendant to Jernegan&#8217;s gold-from-sea-water
scheme, Mrs. Howe&#8217;s bank, and Miller&#8217;s
syndicate, all fresh in the memory of everyone,
comes the &#8220;lucky-box&#8221; humbug and its
humiliating exposure, as I write. Upon the
simple assurance that the possessor of this marvellous
box (which could be carried in the
pocket) would become instantly lucky, thousands
were quickly sold, and the sale of more thousands
was only stopped by the prompt intervention
of the law!</p>

<span class="subhead">CHARMS AGAINST DISEASE</span></h2>

<p class="center b1">&#8220;I&#8217;ll do, I&#8217;ll do, and I&#8217;ll do.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Shakespeare.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Under</span> this heading we shall first call attention
to those plants having the alleged
power to cure disease or protect from evil influences.
But before doing so, we would suggest
that the reader turn to his standard or popular
dictionary. He will there find the magical
word &#8220;abracadabra&#8221; defined as a charm
against fevers.</p>

<p>In former times, the young, unrolled fronds
of the male fern were supposed to guard the
wearer against the Evil Eye or witchcraft; and
were not only worn by the credulous, but also
given to the cattle as a charm against being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
<span class="locked">bewitched.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> Moonwort fern had the reputation
of being able to undo any lock, bolt, or bar, or
even to draw nails from the shoe of any horse
treading upon it; and mistletoe to be a sure
cure for the stone.</p>

<p>The roots and flowers of violets are supposed
to moderate anger, and to comfort and
strengthen the heart&mdash;hence the significant
name of heartsease.</p>

<p>St.-John&#8217;s-wort is still gathered in some parts
of the Old Country on the Eve of St. John the
Baptist, and hung out over the windows and
doors, in accord with the ancient superstition
that it would keep out all evil spirits, and shield
the inmates from storms and other calamities.</p>

<p>The belief associated with holly, now so generally
used for Christmas decoration, comes
from Pliny, who writes that &#8220;the branches of
this tree defend houses from lightning, and
men from witchcraft.&#8221; The common mullein
was also held to have potency against hurts
inflicted by wild beasts, or any evil coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
near; and, similarly, the mountain ash was
considered a protection against the Evil Eye,
witches, and warlocks. So, also, a sea-onion
was often hung in the doorway, with a like
object.</p>

<p>Another charm said to be very efficacious,
though the writer has not tried it himself, yet
having the sanction of age, is this: &#8220;Against a
woman&#8217;s chatter, taste at night, fasting, the
root of a radish; on that day the chatter cannot
harm thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many of the myths concerning plants still
exist in a modified form among us, although it
is no doubt true that most people who decorate
their houses with evergreens and holly at Christmastide
are ignorant of the mysticism they so
innocently perpetuate. Yet the Puritan fathers
of New England were as utterly opposed to the
decorating of houses of worship with &#8220;Christmas
Greens,&#8221; as to the observance of the day
itself. Could they but revisit the scenes of
their earthly labors during that season of unstinted
festivity and good cheer, when man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
heart is so warmed through the medium of his
stomach, how shocked they would be to see</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Gilt holly with its thorny pricks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yew and box, with berries small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These deck the unused candlesticks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pictures hanging by the wall.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Beyond a doubt, most of the long-standing
beliefs, touching the remedies for this or that
ailment, belong to a time when the services of a
skilled physician or surgeon were not to be had
for love or money, or medical aid be instantly
summoned to the sick man&#8217;s bedside by telephone.
This was especially true of the sparsely
settled parts of the country, where every prudent
housewife laid in a stock of roots and
herbs against sickness in the family. Some of
what nowadays are called &#8220;popular remedies,&#8221;
are found in Josselyn&#8217;s &#8220;Rarities.&#8221; Here are
a few of <span class="locked">them:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The skin of a hawk is good to wear on the
stomach for the pain and coldness of it. Lameness
(or rheumatic pains) may be cured by lying
on a bearskin. Seal oil being cast upon coals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
will bring women out of their mother fits.&#8221;
The white cockle-shell was very good to stanch
blood. For a rattlesnake bite, &#8220;their hearts
swallowed fresh, is a good antidote against their
Venom, and their liver (the Gall taken out)
bruised and applied to their Bitings is a present
Remedy&mdash;&#8221; a clear proof, it seems to us, that
the theory of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">similia similibus curantur</i>, did not
originate with Dr. Koch, or even with the justly
eminent Professor Pasteur.</p>

<p>But even the wonderful advance made by
medical science is powerless to eradicate the
superstitions concerning disease, which live and
thrive in spite of progress, like the noxious
weeds that baffle all the farmer&#8217;s vigilance.
Then, there is a considerable constituency who,
after making a trial of the regular school of
medicine, to no avail, naturally fall back upon
the <i>flotsam</i> and <i>jetsam</i> of bygone times, as a
drowning man is said to grasp at a straw. As
regards the former statement it may be asserted,
as of personal knowledge, that inherited diseases,
such as humors, scrofula, fits and the like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
and even birthmarks, in many parts of the country,
are still looked upon and talked about, not
as a misfortune, but as a visitation upon the
family so afflicted. I once heard one of these
unfortunates described as &#8220;that fitty man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The advent of Sirius, or the dog-star, was
formerly supposed to exert an occult influence
upon poor humanity. In that critical season all
people were advised to look carefully to their
diet, to shun all broiled, salted, and strong
meats, and to drink small beer and such other
liquors as aids to digestion.</p>

<p>As touching those natural objects having
reputed curative properties or virtues, perhaps
the common horsechestnut is the most familiar,
for the widespread belief in its power to charm
away the rheumatism. Several gentlemen of
my acquaintance habitually carry this magical
nut on their persons, and one was actually found
in the pocket of a drowned man while this chapter
was being written. Yet I have known those
who preferred the potato. A gentleman to
whom I happened to mention the subject one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
day, to my profound surprise, immediately drew
forth a healthy-looking tuber of a large size,
which he emphatically asserted to be the only
thing that had ever relieved a severe attack of
rheumatism. I have also known nutmegs to be
perforated, and hung round the neck, for a similar
purpose.</p>

<p>Wearing eel-skin garters is also more or less
practised as a cure for the same complaint.</p>

<p>Putting sulphur in the shoes is also highly
commended as a cure for rheumatism. I have
known the same thing done as a preventive
against an attack of grippe.</p>

<p>Plain or galvanized iron finger rings are also
worn for their supposed property to cure the
rheumatism.</p>

<p>Another well-to-do business man gravely assured
me that a nutmeg, suspended round the
neck by a string, was a sure cure for boils
&#8220;&mdash;and no mistake about it&mdash;&#8221; and strongly
urged giving it a trial.</p>

<p>Corns and warts likewise are cured by carrying
a horsechestnut on the person. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
way is to rub the wart with a copper coin,
throwing the coin away immediately after. The
person picking it up transfers the fungus to
himself. Still another way is to first stick a pin
in the wart, then to go and stick the same pin
into an apple tree, though in England they say
it must be an ash. The notion that such things
were &#8220;catching&#8221; seems to have suggested, in a
way to be easily understood, the theory of disease
transference, to common folk. With this
view a puppy is sometimes put into the same
bed with a sick child, in the belief that the sickness
will pass from the child to the puppy,
while both are asleep. A case, in which this
remedy was tried, came to my knowledge very
recently.</p>

<p>To return to the subject of warts, some countryfolk
highly recommend making the sign of
the cross against the chimney-back with a piece
of chalk, asserting that, as soon as the mark is
covered with soot, the warts will go away.
Others, equally skilled in this sort of cures,
contend that if you steal some beans, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
secretly bury them in the ground the disagreeable
excrescences will leave you. Should all
else fail you must then sell your warts or corns
to somebody. Who&#8217;ll buy? Who&#8217;ll buy?</p>

<p>Should you have a decayed tooth extracted,
the molar must instantly be thrown into the
fire, or you will surely have a cat&#8217;s tooth come
in its place. To dream of losing your teeth
is, by many, considered a sure sign of coming
trouble. Jet, powdered and mixed with wine,
was once thought to be a sure remedy for the
toothache.</p>

<p>Wearing a caul is a sure protection against
drowning.</p>

<p>One must not kiss a cat; the doing so will
expose one to catch some disease.</p>

<p>Hostlers and stable boys believe that it
keeps horses healthy to have a goat about
the stable.</p>

<p>A gold wedding-ring is believed to be a cure
for sties.</p>

<p>Wearing red yarn around the neck is esteemed
a prevention against nose-bleeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Sticking your jack-knife into the head of
the bed will prevent cramps. Another way
is to put both your slippers by your bedside,
bottoms up, before retiring for the night.
Should you neglect this, the cramps will
surely return. The gentleman who gave me
this receipt, said he got it from his mother.
The old way, as laid down in the books, was
to lay out your shoes in the form of a cross,
before retiring.</p>

<p>In some country districts, a heavy growth
of foliage is considered a certain forerunner
of coming sickness. The blossoming of trees,
in autumn, also forebodes an epidemic of sickness.</p>

<p>It is a matter of common knowledge, that
tooth charmers continue to carry on a more
or less lucrative trade in the country towns.
&#8220;What did she do to you?&#8221; was asked of a
countryman who had just paid a visit to one
of these cunning women, at the urgent solicitation
of a friend. &#8220;Do?&#8221; was the bewildered
answer, &#8220;why, she didn&#8217;t do nothing at all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
but just said over something to herself, and
the pain was all gone in a minute.&#8221; This
person, like a great many others, had a rooted
aversion to having a tooth &#8220;hauled,&#8221; as he
expressed it, and would have suffered untold
tortures from an aching tooth, rather than
have gone to a regular practitioner. One
woman, in particular, whom I have in mind,
enjoys a wide reputation in the neighborhood
where she practises her healing art. She
simply mutters some incantation, or spell, and
<i>presto</i>! the most excruciating pain is conjured
away; so &#8217;tis said.</p>

<p>There is a very old belief touching the
virtue of a halter, that has done service in
hanging a criminal, to charm away the headache.
Probably other powers are attributed
to this barbarous instrument of death, for it
is said to be a fact, that the negroes of the
southern States will pay a great price for a
piece of the hangman&#8217;s noose, to be kept in
the house, as a charm.</p>

<p>The madstone is claimed to be a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
remedy for the bite of rabid dogs, snake bites
and the like. The wonderful cures effected
by one of these magic stones, owned by a
lady living in Mississippi (references being
given to quite a number of well-known people,
who had either tested the remarkable
properties of this particular stone, or who
had personal knowledge of the facts), went
the rounds of the newspapers some years
ago. Upon being applied to the wound or
bite, the stone adhered to it until the virus
was absorbed. It then fell off, and after
being well cleaned, was again applied until
it failed to hold. When this took place, the
patient was considered out of danger. With
this stone it was claimed that the bite of a
mad dog could be cured at any time before
hydrophobia had set in.</p>

<p>A similar case is reported from Virginia,
with details that leave no doubt of the honesty
of the principals concerned.</p>

<p>This was the famous Upperville madstone,
which has been in the hands of the Fred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
family for over one hundred and fifty years.
As its name indicates, the peculiar property of
this stone is its apparent appetite for the virus
to be found in the wound made by the bite of
any venomous animal. This is the owner&#8217;s story:</p>

<p>&#8220;The stone was brought to Virginia in 1740
by Joshua Fred, who was a well-to-do farmer in
Warwickshire, England, and became an important
landowner in Fauquier County. By his
wish his descendants had clung to this stone as
a priceless heirloom, and I am proud to say that
their use of it has always reflected credit upon
the good, old-fashioned hospitality and kindliness
characteristic of Virginians. It was well
known all over the country that anybody might
go to the Fred farm with any unfortunate who
had been bitten by a dog, and enjoy a certain
cure without any cost. For a hundred years
none of the Freds would permit any one who
was cured in this way by the madstone to pay
a farthing, even for board or lodging or horse
feed. In later years the vicissitudes of peace
and war having somewhat affected the fortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of various members of the family, it became
the practice to allow visitors who came to use
the madstone to pay what they pleased for their
entertainment and for the care of their teams.
Beyond this, however, no charge whatever was
made for scores of most remarkable cures.</p>

<p>&#8220;A journal was kept by the various members
of the family who had charge of the madstone,
in which was entered the name and age of
every person on whom it was used, and the
character of the wound treated. The entries
in this book, made in the quaint handwriting of
member after member of the family, the most
of whom have long since turned to dust in their
graves, are most interesting.</p>

<p>&#8220;While the stone was in my possession I had
occasion several times to use it upon persons
who were brought to me in great agony of mind
over wounds they had received from the bite of
rabid dogs. The last case occurred just a few
days before the sale of the stone. A young
boy was brought to my house late at night,
who had been bitten on the wrist. The wound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
was an ugly one, and the father was in great
distress of mind for fear hydrophobia would set
in. I placed the stone on the boy&#8217;s wrist at
about ten o&#8217;clock and went to bed. The father
stayed up and took care of the boy. At two
o&#8217;clock in the morning, he said, the stone let
go. The boy was then sound asleep. The
father placed the stone, as I had told him to
do, in a glass of milk, on which, when I saw
it in the morning, there was a thick green
scum. This seemed to be the usual result in
all such cases. The stone was never known to
let go until it had extracted all the poison, and,
on being placed in a glass of warm water or
milk, discharged a greenish liquid. The stone
itself is perhaps an inch long by three-quarters
wide, and is of a velvety, grayish brown color.
Years ago it was accidentally broken in two,
and the jeweller who placed a gold band around
it to hold it together has told me that the inside
was a little darker than the outside and was
arranged in concentric layers.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>
<p>As an antidote against the bite of a dog, you
must procure some of the hair of the dog that
has bitten you. This has passed into a proverb
among habitual topers, with particular reference
to taking another &#8220;nip.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is also a more or less current belief,
better grounded perhaps than many others of
a like nature, that a dog which has bitten a
person should not be killed until unmistakable
symptoms of rabies have appeared.</p>

<p>Who does not remember the &#8220;blue-glass
craze&#8221; of some fifteen years ago, which spread
like wildfire over the land, and as suddenly died
out? Whole communities went blue-glass mad.
It was enough for some one to have advanced
the theory that the cerulean rays were a
cure-all, for everybody to accept it with as
much confidence as if it had been one of the
demonstrated facts of science. Dealers in blue-glass
were about the only ones to benefit by the
craze which infallibly suggests its own moral,
namely, that credulity has not wholly disappeared.
Is this doubted when hardly a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
goes by in which some miraculous cure is not
heralded abroad by the newspapers? Sometimes
it is performed merely by the laying on
of hands; and most often without the aid of
medicines. Indeed, within a few years, there
has sprung up a new school of healing, numbering
its tens of thousands proselytes, which not
only sets all the best established principles and
traditions of the old schools at defiance, but also
literally &#8220;throws physic to the dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The practice of dipping in the healing waters
of the ocean as a cure-all, or preventive of disease
for the coming year, formerly prevailed on
the Maine coast, particularly at Old Orchard
Beach and in the immediate neighborhood, to a
very great extent. In its nature and inception
the practice certainly more nearly approached
the character of those annual pilgrimages made
to the famous shrines of the Old World than
anything which has come to my notice. Not to
mince words, it proceeded from the same superstitious
idea, just how originating no one can
say. So, every year, on the anniversary of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
John the Baptist&#8217;s day, a curious assemblage of
country-folk, for miles around, moved by a common
impulse, wended their way to the nearest
beaches, there to dip in the briny waters,
believed to be invested with especial healing
powers on this day only, like the bargains
advertised to draw custom, and thereby be freed
from all the ills which flesh is heir to. On that
sacramental day of days, one saw a long string
of nondescript wagons, loaded with old and
young, moving along the sandy roads leading
down from their inland homes to the salt sea.
Even the school children thought that they, too,
must dip, in imitation of their elders. For
some unknown reason, the day, which not only
had the sanction of long custom but also is
hallowed by such venerated traditions, was
given up for the 26th, which is quite like any
other day of the year.</p>

<p>As all superstitious folk are generally the
last to admit that they are so, so in this instance
the followers of this singular custom in general
either maintain a discreet silence on the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
or refuse to say more than that they go to the
beach to bathe, on a fixed day, and at no other
time, because other folks do so. The custom
undoubtedly arose from a firm belief in the
miraculous power of the waters to heal the sick,
make the weak strong and the lame to walk&mdash;on
that day only. That it is a most healthful
one few will deny, and as cleanliness is said to
be next to godliness, an annual dip at Old
Orchard is, at least, one step toward the more
spiritual condition.</p>

<p>But it would be a mistake to suppose this
singular custom to be an article of religious
faith. It simply illustrates the mental and
moral stamina of the period in which it flourished.
For if founded in faith alone, there is
strong probability that it might have survived
the ridicule to which it has mostly, if not quite,
succumbed.</p>

<p>Whether it be merely a coincidence or not, it
is fact that June 26th is also the anniversary of
the festival of St. Anne, to whose shrine annual
pilgrimages are made by the faithful in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
northern parts of the United States and in Canada
for purposes quite similar to those which
once attracted a host of bathers to the Maine
beaches, with the difference that the Canadian
shrine can show many visible tokens of its marvellous
curative powers, to be seen of all men.
A visitor to the little church of St. Anne, de
Beaupré, remarks that &#8220;by far the most conspicuous
feature of the place was a towering
trophy of crutches and canes raised within the
altar rail. These were of all sizes and shapes.
Two fresh additions rested against the rail, where
they had been left by their recovered owners.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently authentic accounts of miracles,
performed at this venerated shrine, appear from
time to time in the Canadian newspapers. One
of these relates, as a matter of news, that &#8220;a
young girl named Marie Levesque, who had
only walked with difficulty during the last two
years, with the aid of crutches, was radically
cured. The second case was that of a young
Irish lad, who, on returning from the church to
the boat which was to take him to Quebec,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
suddenly threw away his crutch, exclaiming to
one of his companions as he did so, &#8216;Oh! I forgot
to leave my crutch in the church.&#8217; &#8216;But
you will want it again,&#8217; was the reply. &#8216;No,
not at all: I have no longer any use for it.&#8217;
And with that, he began walking about the
deck, to all appearance as well as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to these cases, which come to us
through reputable sources, the <cite>Quebec Gazette</cite>
records the following: &#8220;A man named Renaud,
who accompanied the party from St. James&#8217;
parish on Saturday, and who for three years
has had one side of his body completely
paralyzed, was able on Sunday to walk out
of church leaning on the arm of his brother.
A farmer named Moulin, from Laprairie,
who has been deaf for five years, fell on
the floor apparently senseless, just as the officiating
priest was pronouncing the benediction.
He declared that when the priest raised his
hands he could feel a touch upon his ear, and at
the same moment, hearing the low tones of the
Holy Father, fainted away from excess of joy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
He is said to have been in perfect possession
of his sense of hearing on his return home.
Another man, who had lost his sight through
an attack of typhoid fever a year and a half
ago, states that immediately after crossing himself
with the holy water he was well able to see
all that was going on. His name is Bruneau,
and he is a Lavaltrie farmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following cure for the croup was communicated
to me by a very respectable farmer
now deceased. After talking of various remedies
for this dreaded scourge to young children,
my informant observed that he knew
a sure cure for it. Said he: &#8220;Take a live
chicken, cut it open and take out the gizzard.
Throw that into a basin of cold water and
let it stay there. I know, for I&#8217;ve seen it
tried; but the chicken must be alive after the
operation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of a like nature was the advice given to a
poor country woman who was dying of consumption,
by one of those female charlatans
who have so legitimately replaced the fearsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
witch doctors of the past. The patient
was told that if she would swallow a live frog
daily it would cure her. Poor creature! she had
half the boys in the village catching frogs for
her, and kept them in a tub in the cellar,
where they could be handy. The treatment
proved too heroic. She died.</p>

<p>It is a fact that touching for the King&#8217;s
Evil has been practised in New England as
late as 1815, perhaps even later. By far the
most remarkable instance of the possession
of this power that has been recorded upon
what seems like incontrovertible evidence, is
that of Lieutenant William Robbe of Peterborough,
New <span class="locked">Hampshire.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> One feature of
his treatment, which no doubt served to draw
many clients to him, was the practice of giving
to each afflicted person a piece of silver.
In fact, so many applied that the lieutenant
was seriously interrupted in his legitimate
occupations.</p>

<p>A Doctor Young, who in the account referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
to is described as having been an eminent
practitioner for more than forty years
in the town, is said to have declared that infants
afflicted with scrofulous diseases, tumors
and the like, too obstinate to yield to medical
aid, did unquestionably receive almost immediate
relief from the healing hand of Lieutenant
Robbe.</p>

<p>The wonderful healer continued to practise
his semi-miraculous treatment until he was no
longer able to raise his hands, but even then,
so eager were the applicants, many of whom
came from a distance, not to be disappointed,
that the feeble hands were lifted for him to
the sufferer&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>In &#8220;Supernaturalism in New England,&#8221; Mr.
Whittier speaks of one Austin, a New Hampshire
Quaker, who practised mental healing in
his day. Those who were unable to visit him
were treated by letter. In truth, there is no
new thing under the sun.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">What</span> are the supposed attributes of certain
precious stones but another form
of superstition? According to the popular
lore on this subject, each gem has its peculiar
virtue or virtues, with which the credulous
owner becomes forthwith invested. Authorities
differ so much, however, in regard to this
mystical language that there cannot be said
to be any settled standard of meaning. If,
therefore, we refer only to such precious
stones as have some superstition attached to
them, we shall do all that comes within the
range of our present purpose.</p>

<p>In &#8220;A Lover&#8217;s Complaint,&#8221; Shakespeare sets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
forth, as understood in his day, &#8220;Each stone&#8217;s
dear nature, worth, and quality.&#8221;</p>

<p>We accept, therefore, without reserve, as a
starting point his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dictum</i> <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">

<p class="in0">indicated two extremes of passion, namely, shrinking

<span class="i0">The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With objects manifold.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Those interested in the sale of gems have
observed that most precious stones have their
brief day of popular favor, regardless of any
superstition connected with them. In other
words, the popularity of certain jewels chiefly
depends upon the public taste, for the time
being. And the demand, therefore, fluctuates
according as the particular stone is fashionable
or unfashionable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
It would require a volume to give the subject
fair treatment, so long is the list, and so
abundant the material. Hardly a week goes
by, however, in which some reference to the
good or evil influence of this or that gem is
not set forth in the public press, supported,
too, by such an array of circumstantial evidence
as to give color and authenticity to the
story. The opal and the moonstone are the
gems most often figuring in these tales. By
turns the opal has borne a good and bad
reputation; by turns it has been as fashionable
as its rare beauty would seem of right
to bespeak for it; and then again, owing to
popular caprice or the sudden revival of some
antiquated superstition, it has laid neglected
in the jewellers&#8217; drawer for years.</p>

<p>The notion that the opal brings misfortune
to the wearer is comparatively modern. Formerly,
it was believed to possess great virtues
as a talisman. In Ben Jonson&#8217;s &#8220;New Inn,&#8221;
Ferret <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i2">&#8220;No fern seed in my pocket; nor an opal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt in bay-leaf, in my left fist, to charm<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Thine eyes withal.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Jonson&#8217;s and Shakespeare&#8217;s time, the
opal was justly prized for its quick changes
of color, exhibiting, as it does, almost all of
the hues of the rainbow in rapid succession.
It is quaintly described in an account of that
day as &#8220;a precious stone of divers colors,
wherein appeareth the fiery shining of the
carbuncle, the purple color of the amethyst,
and the green shew of the emerald, very
strangely mixed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quite naturally, dealers in gems have no
patience with those superstitions unfavorable to
the sale of their wares, although they show no
particular dislike toward those of a different
nature, if their sales are thereby increased. So
when a customer asks for something synonymous
with good luck, the obliging dealer usually
offers him a moonstone, and after a little
chaffering the buyer departs, possessed of a
duly authenticated amulet, or charm. Agate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
another stone having, by common fame, the
property of insuring long life, health, and prosperity
to the wearer. The present Emperor of
Germany is said, on good authority, to affect
this stone. Now the ancient magician, who
sold charms and love-philters to love-lorn
swains, did no more than this, with the difference
that he pretended to endow his nostrums
with their supernatural powers by his own arts.</p>

<p>Indeed, the very word &#8220;charms&#8221; so innocently
given to a bunch of jingling objects
dangling from the belt or watch-chain, is itself
indicative of a superstitious origin, to say the
least.</p>

<p>As an example of the change wrought by the
tyrant fashion in the supposed attributes of
certain gems, the ruby was formerly considered
the correct thing for an engagement ring, but
that stone is now almost wholly superseded by
the diamond for that highly interesting event;
though the ruby continues to be regarded as a
valuable gift upon other occasions, and if of a
fine quality, is much more costly than a diamond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Very possibly the familiar Biblical
phrase, &#8220;for her price is far above rubies,&#8221;
spoken of the truly virtuous woman in Proverbs,
may have suggested the peculiar fitness
of this gem in a promise of marriage. If so,
we can only regret the substitution.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most plausible explanation given
for the present popularity of the diamond&mdash;it
must, however, be a <i>solitaire</i> of the purest
water&mdash;is that, as the diamond is the most
durable substance known, so it is hoped that
it may symbolize an enduring affection between
the contracting parties. Though in itself nothing
but a symbol or sign, the gift of an engagement
ring is considered as evidence in a breach
of promise case, thus showing that the very
ancient custom in use among princes or noble
personages of sending their signet-rings with
messages of high importance, to give credit to
the messenger, lives on in the spirit, if not in
the actual letter, of the law, as applied to the
sacred pledge of fidelity to one&#8217;s promise to
wed.</p>

A very conscientious dealer once told me
that if a young gentleman were to ask his
advice concerning an engagement ring, he
should dissuade the amorous youth from buying
an emerald, on the ground that the young
lady might regard it as a bad omen, possibly
on account of its color which, as we have
pointed out, is or was considered unlucky; but
more probably, we think, because the emerald
is said to be the chosen symbol of the &#8220;green-eyed
monster,&#8221; jealousy. An old jeweller
readily confirms the opinion that many young
ladies would be unwilling to accept an emerald
at such a time; while still another adds that
he never knew of one being given as an engagement
gift. The novelist Black makes use
of this superstition in his &#8220;Three Feathers,&#8221;
as something universally admitted, &#8220;for how,&#8221;
he naïvely asks, &#8220;could any two people marry
who had engaged themselves with an emerald
ring?&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctors disagree, however, as to the actual
properties of this beautiful gem, as well as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
other things, for we find one authority saying
that the emerald &#8220;discovers false witnesses,
and ensures happiness in love and domestic
felicity.&#8221;</p>

<p>In justice, therefore, to this much abused
stone, we must declare that our research thus
far fails to confirm the odium sought to be
cast upon it, in any particular; on the contrary,
so far as we can find, not one jot or
tittle of superstition attached to the emerald
so long ago as when New England was settled.
A learned writer of that time describes
it as &#8220;a precious stone, the greenest of all
other; for which it is very comfortable to the
sight,&#8221; and he adds, on the authority of Albertus
Magnus, that &#8220;some affirm them (emeralds)
to be taken out of Griffon&#8217;s nests, who do
keep this stone with great sedulity. It is
found by experience that if the emerald be
good, it inclineth the wearer to chastity.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is therefore highly improbable, to say the
least, that this article of superstitious faith
came over in the <i class="ship">Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
The turquoise has long proved a puzzle to
the most experienced dealers in gems, on
account of its singular property of changing
color without apparent cause. Ordinarily it
is of a beautiful blue&mdash;about the color of a
robin&#8217;s egg. This color sometimes changes to
green, and again, though unfrequently, to
white. In relating his experience with this
stone to me, an old friend described his surprise
as well as alarm at having a very valuable
specimen, which was &#8220;beautifully blue&#8221;
when put in the workman&#8217;s hands to be set
with diamonds, returned to him covered with
a white film, nearly concealing the original
blue color. As the turquoise itself was worth
several hundred dollars, it really was a rather
serious matter. The erratic stone, however,
was put away in the safe. When the purchaser
called for it on the following day, on
its being taken out of the box, it was found
that the true color had partly returned, one
half of the stone being blue, and the other
half white. &#8220;And we even fancied&#8221; continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
my informant, &#8220;that we could see the
color change as we watched it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This change of color in the turquoise gave
rise to the belief that its hue varied with the
health of the wearer, it being blue when the
wearer was in good health and green or
white in the case of ill-health, or as put into
<span class="locked">verse:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;A compassionate turquoise that doth tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By looking pale the wearer is not well.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As coral is again becoming quite fashionable,
we recall that it was once considered a
sure protection against the Evil Eye, and is
so still in Italy, where the little coral charm
shaped like the hand, with the thumb and
middle finger closed (a charm against witchcraft),
comes from. It is also a more or less
general belief that coral or red beads, worn
round the neck, prevent nose-bleeding, on the
principle, we suppose, that like cures like.</p>

<p>The carnelian, shaped in the form of a heart,
was formerly much worn as an amulet.</p>

<p>The amethyst, as its Greek name implies, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
considered an antidote to intoxication. It has
now a formidable rival in the gold-cure. There
is an anecdote of the first Napoleon which
affirms that he took a valuable amethyst from
the crown in the coffin of Charlemagne. The
stolen stone later came into the possession of
Napoleon III., who wore it as a seal on his
watch-guard. In his will he bequeathed the
stone to his son as a talisman. On making her
escape from Paris, in 1870, the empress took
the historical stone with her.</p>

<p>The carbuncle was formerly believed to guard
the wearer against the danger of breathing
infectious air. It was also said to have the
property of shining in the dark, like a burning
coal, thus investing it, in the minds of the
credulous, with supernatural power. This, be
it said, was an Old-World superstition, which is
referred to in some verses written by John
Chalkhill (1649), describing a witch&#8217;s <span class="locked">cave:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Through which the carbuncle and diamond shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not set by art, but there by Nature sown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the world&#8217;s birth so star-like bright they shone.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
But strangely enough, our forefathers found a
similar belief existing among the Indians of
New England, and what is more, these ignorant
savages were able to convince the more civilized
Englishmen of the truth of it.</p>

<p>According to these Indians, on the loftiest
mountain peak, suspended from a crag overhanging
a dismal lake, there was an enormous
carbuncle, which many declared they had seen
blazing in the night like a live coal; while by
day it emitted blinding rays of light, dazzling
to look upon. No mortal could hope to lay
hands upon this gem, which was under the
special guardianship of the genius of the
mountain.</p>

<p>So ran the legend. It is believed to have
inspired the earliest recorded journeys to the
great White Mountains of New Hampshire, by
adventurous whites. A reference to Sullivan&#8217;s
&#8220;History of Maine&#8221; shows that the story
found full credence among certain of the ignorant
settlers even in his day; and Hawthorne&#8217;s
grewsome tale of &#8220;The Great Carbuncle&#8221; is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
founded upon this weird legend, so vividly recalling
those of the Harz and the Caucasus.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that, in the matter of superstitions
concerning gems, it is not the common
people, but the wealthy who alone are able to
gratify their desires. Everybody has heard of
the Rothschild pearls. The Princess Louise
of Lorne wears a ring of jet, as a preserver of
health. M. Zola carries a bit of coral as a talisman
against all sorts of perils by land or water;
all of which goes to show that neither wealth
nor station is exempt from those secret influences
which so readily affect the poor and
lowly.</p>

<span class="subhead">OF LOVE AND MARRIAGE</span></h2>

<p class="center b1">&#8220;Now for good lucke, cast an old shoe after me.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Heywood.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">The</span> folk-lore of marriage is probably the
most interesting feature of the general
subject, to the tender sex, at least, with whom
indeed none other, in the nature of things,
could begin to hold so important a place. In
consequence, all favorable or unfavorable omens
are carefully treasured up in the memory, quite
as much pains being taken to guard against
evil prognostics as to propitiate good fortune.</p>

<p>Quite naturally, the young unmarried woman
is possessed of a burning desire to find out who
her future husband is to be, what he is like,
whether he is rich or poor, short or tall, and if
they twain are to be happy in the married state
or not. To this end the oracle is duly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
consulted, either openly or secretly, after the
best approved methods.</p>

<p>One of the best known modes of divination
is this: If, fortunately, you find the pretty little
lady-bird bug on your clothes, throw it up in
the air, repeating at the same time the <span class="locked">invocation:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Fly away east and fly away west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show me where lives the one I love best.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All charms of this nature are supposed to
possess peculiar power if tried on St. Valentine&#8217;s
day, Christmas Eve, or Hallowe&#8217;en.
Curious it is that on a day dedicated to All
the Saints in the Calendar, evil spirits, fairies,
and the like are supposed to be holding a sort
of magic revel unchecked, or that they should
be thought to be better disposed to gratify the
desires of inquisitive mortals on this day than
on another. At any rate, calendar or no calendar,
St. Matrimony is the patron saint of
Hallowe&#8217;en.</p>

<p>Among the many methods of divination
employed, a favorite one was to drop melted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
lead into a bowl of water, though any other sort
of vessel would do as well, and whatever form
the lead might take would signify the occupation
of your future husband. Or to go out of
doors in the dark, with a ball of yarn, and
unwind it until some one should begin winding
it at the unwound end. At this trial, the
expected often happened, as the enamored
swain would seldom fail to be on the watch for
his sweetheart to appear. So also the white of
an egg dropped in water, and set in the sun,
was supposed to take on the form of some
object, such as a ship under full sail, indicating
that your husband would be a sailor.</p>

<p>Burning the nuts is perhaps the most popular
mode of trying conclusions with fate, as it certainly
is the most mirth-provoking. On this
interesting occasion, lads and lassies arrange
themselves in a circle before a blazing wood
fire, on the hearth. Nuts are produced.
Each person, after naming his or her nut, puts
it upon the glowing coals, with the unspoken
<span class="locked">invocation:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;If he loves me, pop and fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he hates me, live and die.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poet Gay turns this somewhat differently,
but it is not our affair to reconcile conflicting
presages. He <span class="locked">sings:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Two hazel nuts I threw into the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to each nut I gave a sweetheart&#8217;s name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This with the loudest bounce me sore amazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in a flame of brightest color blazed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As blazed the nut so may the passions grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For &#8216;twas thy nut that did so brightly glow.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A still different rendering is given by Burns.
According to him each questioner of the charm
names two nuts, one for himself, one for his
sweetheart, presumably the mode practised in
Scotland in his <span class="locked">time:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Jean slips in twa wi&#8217; tentie e&#8217;e;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wha &#8217;twas, she wadna tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this is Jock, an&#8217; this is me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She says in to hersel&#8217;:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He blaz&#8217;d o&#8217;er her, an&#8217; she owre him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As they wad never mair part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Till, fuff! he started up the lum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An&#8217; Jean had e&#8217;en a sair heart<br /></span>
<span class="i12">To see&#8217;t that night.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Popping corn sometimes takes the place of
burning the nuts. The spoken invocation is
then &#8220;Pit, put, turn inside out!&#8221;</p>

<p>There are also several methods of performing
this act of divination with apples. The one
most practised in New England is this: First
pare an apple. If you succeed in removing the
peel all in one piece, throw it over your head,
and should the charm work well, the peel will
so fall as to form the first letter of your future
husband&#8217;s name, or as Gay poetically puts <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;I pare this pippin round and round again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My shepherd&#8217;s name to nourish on the plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fling th&#8217; unbroken paring o&#8217;er my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the grass a perfect L is read.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When sleeping in a strange bed for the first
time, name the four posts for some of your male
friends. The post that you first look at, upon
waking in the morning, bears the name of the
one whom you will marry. Care is usually
taken to fall asleep on the right side of the bed.</p>

<p>By walking down the cellar stairs backward,
holding a mirror over your head as you go, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
face of the person whom you will marry will
presently appear in the mirror.</p>

<p>The oracle of the daisy flower, so effectively
made use of in Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Faust,&#8221; is of great
antiquity, and is perhaps more often consulted
by blushing maidens than any other. When
plucking away the snowy petals, the fair questioner
of fate should murmur low to herself the
cabalistic <span class="locked">formula:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;&#8216;He loves me, loves me not,&#8217; she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bending low her dainty head<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O&#8217;er the daisy&#8217;s mystic spell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8216;He loves me, loves me not, he loves,&#8217;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She murmurs &#8217;mid the golden groves<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the corn-fields on the fell.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the last leaf falls, so goes the prophecy.</p>

<p>If you put a four-leaved clover in your shoe
before going out for a walk, you will presently
meet the one you are to marry. The same
charm is used to bring back an absent or wayward
lover. Consequently there is much looking
for this bashful little plant at all of our
matrimonial resorts. The rhymed version runs
in this <span class="locked">wise:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;A clover, a clover of two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put it in your right shoe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first young man you meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In field, street, or lane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You&#8217;ll get him, or one of his name.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In some localities a bean-pod or a pea-pod
put over the door acts as a charm to bring the
favored of fortune to lift the latch and walk in.
This is old. The poet Gay has it in rhyme
<span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;As peascods once I pluck&#8217;d, I chanc&#8217;d to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One that was closely filled with three times three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which when I cropp&#8217;d, I safely home convey&#8217;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o&#8217;er the door the spell in secret laid:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The latch moved up, when who should first come in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in his proper person&mdash;Lubberkin!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another mode of divination runs in this way:
On going to bed the girl eats two spoonfuls of
salt. The salt causes her to dream that she is
dying of thirst; and whoever the young man
may be that brings her a cup of water, in her
dream, is the one she will <span class="locked">marry.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>
<p>If after seeing a white horse you count a
hundred, the first gentleman you meet will be
your future husband.</p>

<p>So far as appearances go, at least, the custom
of brewing love-philters or love-potions, to
forestall or force the natural inclinations, has
completely died out. From this source the
astrologers, magicians, and fortune-tellers of
former times reaped a rich harvest. Many
instances of the use of this old custom occur
in literature. Josselyn naïvely relates the only
one we can call to mind, coming near home to
us. He says: &#8220;I once took notice of a wanton
woman&#8217;s compounding the solid roots of this
plant (Satyrion) with wine, for an amorous cup,
which wrought the desired effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>Would that the hideous and barbarous custom
of administering poisons to gratify the
cravings of hatred or the pangs of jealousy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
had become equally obsolete! But alas! the
&#8220;green-eyed monster&#8221; is &#8220;with us yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a fact, well known to students of folk-lore,
that those customs or usages relating to
marriage are not only among the oldest, but
have become too firmly intrenched in the popular
mind to be easily dislodged. Thus, the
ceremony of Throwing the Shoe continues to
hold an honored place among marriage customs.
In another place, it has been referred
to as sometimes employed in the common concerns
of life. But in the case of marriage, a
somewhat deeper significance is attached to it.
It is but fair to say, however, that authorities
differ widely as to its origin, some referring it
to the testimony of the Scriptures (Deut. xxv.),
where the loosing of a shoe from a man&#8217;s foot
by the woman he has refused to marry, is made
an act of solemn renunciation in the presence
of the elders. Thereafter, the obdurate one
was to be held up to the public scorn, and his
house pointed at as &#8220;the house of him that
hath his shoe loosed.&#8221; So again we read in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Ruth of a man who plucked off his shoe, and
gave it to his kinsman, as an evidence to the
act of renunciation, touching the redeeming of
land, and this, we are there told, was then the
manner in Israel. Hence, it has been very
plausibly suggested, especially by Mr. Thrupp,
in &#8220;Notes and Queries,&#8221; that throwing an old
shoe after a bride was at first a symbol of
renunciation of authority over her, by her
father or guardian. However that may be, it
is certain that no marriage ceremony is considered
complete to-day without it, although
there is danger of its being brought into ridicule,
and so into disrepute, by such nonsensical
acts as tying on old shoes to the bride&#8217;s trunks,
or to some part of her carriage, as I have seen
done here in New England, the original design
of the custom being lost sight of in the too evident
purpose to make the wedded pair as conspicuous
as possible, and their start on life&#8217;s
journey an occasion for the outbreak of ill-timed
buffoonery.</p>

<p>In &#8220;Primitive Marriage&#8221; Mr. McLennan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
thinks that throwing the shoe may be a relic
of the ancient custom, still kept up among certain
Hindu tribes, where the bride, either in
fact or in appearance only, is forcibly carried
off by the groom and his friends, who are, in
turn, themselves hotly pursued and in good
earnest pelted with all manner of missiles,
stones included, by the bride&#8217;s kinsfolk and
tribesmen. This sham assault usually ends in
the pursuers giving up the chase,&mdash;as, indeed,
was intended beforehand,&mdash;and is probably a
survival of the earliest of marriage customs,
namely, that of stealing the bride, as recorded
in ancient history. But this explanation is
chiefly interesting as fixing the <i>status</i> of
woman in those primitive days, when she was
more like the slave of man than his equal.
That relation is now so far reversed, however,
that it is now the man who has become the
humble suitor and declared servitor of womankind.
So, at least, he insists. Now and then,
though quite rarely, the old barbaric custom
is recalled by the forcible abduction of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
unwilling victim by her rejected lover; but
only in a few instances, so far as we know,
has a bride been kidnapped and held to ransom,
in this country, before being restored to
her friends. The American Indians are known
to have practised this custom of stealing the
bride, quite after the manner described by
Mr. McLennan as in vogue among the
Hindus.</p>

<p>Even royalty itself must bow to the behests
of old custom, as well as common mortals.
When the Duke and Duchess of Albany left
Windsor, while they were still within the private
grounds, the bridegroom&#8217;s three brothers
and Princess Louise and Princess Beatrice ran
across a part of the lawn enclosed within a
bend of the drive, each armed with a number
of old shoes, with which they pelted the
&#8220;happy pair.&#8221; The Duke of Albany returned
the fire from the carriage with the ammunition
supplied him by his friendly assailants, causing
the heartiest laughter by a well-directed
shot at the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
It was always reckoned a good omen if the
sun shone on a couple when coming out of
church. Hence the saying: &#8220;Happy is the
bride that the sun shines on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one knows, if not from experience, at
least by observation, what self-consciousness
dwells in a newly married pair&mdash;what pains
they take to appear like old married folk, and
what awkward attempts they make to assume
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dégagé</i> air of ordinary travellers. As
touching this feature of the subject, I one
day saw a carriage driven past me, at which
every one stopped to look, and stare in a way
to attract general attention, and after looking,
gave a broad grin. The reason was apparent.
On the back of the carriage was hung a large
placard, labelled &#8220;Just Married.&#8221; Several old
shoes, besides some long streamers of cheap
cotton cloth, were dangling from the trunks
behind. When the carriage, thus decorated,
drew up at the station, followed by a hooting
crowd of street urchins, it was greeted with
roars of laughter by the throng of idlers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
waiting, while the unconscious cause of it all
first learned on alighting what a sensation
they had so unwittingly created.</p>

<p>The custom of throwing rice over a bride,
as an emblem of fruitfulness, also is very old,
though in England it was originally wheat
that was cast upon her head. The poet
Herrick says to the bride,</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i32">&#8220;While some repeat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your praise and bless you sprinkling you with wheat.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All the sentiment of this pretty and very
significant custom is in danger of being killed
by excess on the part of the performers, who
so often overdo the matter as to render themselves
supremely ridiculous, and the bride very
uncomfortable, to say the least. To scatter
rice, as if one were sowing it by the acre,
when a handful would amply fulfil all the
requirements of the custom, is something as
if an officiating clergyman should pour a pailful
of water on an infant&#8217;s head, instead of
sprinkling it, at a baptism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
It is not surprising that now and then cases
arise where a newly married couple try to
escape from the shower prepared for them
by giving these over-zealous assistants the slip.
A chase then begins corresponding somewhat
to that just related of ignorant barbarians;
and woe to the runaways if the pursuers
should catch up with them!</p>

<p>The custom of furnishing bride-cake at a
wedding is said to be a token of the firm
union between man and wife, just as from
immemorial time breaking bread has been held
to have a symbolic meaning. The custom is
centuries old. At first it was only a cake
of wheat or barley. What it is composed of
now, no man can undertake to say. That it
is conducive to dreaming, or more probably
to nightmare, few, we think, will care to dispute.</p>

<p>We learn that it was a former custom to
cut the bride-cake into little squares or dice,
small enough to be passed through the wedding-ring.
A slice drawn through the ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
thrice (some have it nine times), and afterward
put under the pillow, will make an
unmarried man or woman dream of his or
her future wife or husband. This is another
of those old customs of which trial is so
often made &#8220;just for the fun of the thing,
you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Charivari</i>, or mock serenade, is another
custom still much affected in many places,
notably so in our rural districts, though to our
own mind &#8220;more honored in the breach than
in the observance.&#8221; The averred object is to
make &#8220;night hideous,&#8221; and is usually completely
successful. In the wee sma&#8217; hours,
while sleeping peacefully in their beds, the
newly wedded pair are suddenly awakened by
a most infernal din under their windows, caused
by the blowing of tin horns, the thumping of
tin pans, ringing of cowbells, and like instruments
of torture. To get rid of his tormentors
the bridegroom is expected to hold an impromptu
reception, or, in other words, &#8220;to treat
the crowd,&#8221; which is more often the real object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
of this silly affair, to which we fail to discover
one redeeming feature.</p>

<p>The custom of wearing the wedding ring
upon the left hand originated, so we are told,
in the common belief that the left hand lay
nearest to the heart.</p>

<p>As is well known, the Puritans tried to
abolish the use of the ring in marriage. According
to Butler in &#8220;Hudibras&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Others were for abolishing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tool of matrimony&mdash;a ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which the unsatisfied bridegroom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is married only to a thumb.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The times have indeed changed since in
the early days of New England no Puritan
maiden would have been married with a ring
for worlds. When Edward Winslow was cited
before the Lord&#8217;s Commissioners of Plantations,
upon the complaint of Thomas Morton, he was
asked among other things about the marriage
customs practised in the colony. He answered
frankly that the ceremony was performed by
magistrates. Morton, his accuser, declares that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
the people of New England held the use of a
ring in marriage to be &#8220;a relic of popery, a
diabolical circle for the Devell to daunce in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first marriage in Plymouth Colony, that
of the same Edward Winslow to Susannah
White, was performed by a magistrate, as being
a civil rather than a religious contract. From
this time to 1680, marriages were solemnized
by a magistrate, or by persons specially appointed
for that purpose, who were restricted to
particular towns or districts. Governor Hutchinson,
in his history of Massachusetts, says he
believes &#8220;there was no instance of marriage by
a clergyman during their first charter.&#8221; If a
minister happened to be present, he was desired
to pray. It is difficult to assign the reason why
clergymen were excluded from performing this
ceremony. In new settlements, it must have
been solemnized by persons not always the
most proper for that purpose, considering of
what importance it is to society, that a sense
of this ordinance, at least in some degree
sacred, should be maintained and preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
The first marriage solemnized at Guilford,
Connecticut, took place in the minister&#8217;s house.
It is not learned whether he performed the
ceremony or not. The marriage feast consisted
wholly of pork and beans. As time wore on,
marriages became occasions of much more ceremony
than they were fifty or sixty years ago.
During the Revolutionary period, and even later,
the bride was visited daily for four successive
weeks.</p>

<p>A gold wedding-ring is accounted a sure cure
for sties.</p>

<p>If the youngest daughter of the family
should be married before her older sisters,
they must all dance at her wedding in their
stockings-feet, if they wish to have husbands.</p>

<p>It is strongly enjoined upon a bride, when
being dressed for the marriage ceremony, to
<span class="locked">wear,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;Something old and something new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something borrowed and something blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a four-leaved clover in her shoe.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>June is now at the height of popularity as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the month of all months to get married in,
for no other reason that I can discover, than
that it is the month of roses, when beauty
and plenty pervade the fair face of nature.</p>

<p>It is now the custom for the bride, if she
is married at home, or on returning there
from church, to throw away her bouquet for
the guests to scramble for. The one getting
the most flowers will be married first, and
so on.</p>

<p>Giving wedding presents was not practised
before the present (nineteenth) century.</p>

<p>One old marriage custom, though long since
obsolete, may be briefly alluded to here, not
only for its singularity, but for its suggestiveness
touching a state of mind that would
admit of such tomfoolery. This was the so-called
Smock-marriage, in which the bride
went through the ceremony standing only in
her shift, thereby declaring herself to be possessed
of no more than she came into the
world with. On being duly recorded, the act
exempted the husband from liability for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
wife&#8217;s debts previously contracted. If she
went through this ridiculous performance in
the presence of witnesses, and in the &#8220;King&#8217;s
Highway,&#8221; that is to say, the lawfully laid
out public road, she thereby cleared herself
from any old indebtedness. As amazing as
it may seem, several such cases are recorded
in New England, the formalities observed differing
somewhat in different localities.</p>

<p>It is considered unlucky to get married

or groom to meet a funeral when on their

<p>It is an unlucky omen for the church

death of one of the contracting parties before
the year is out.</p>

the salt, picking up a pin with the point

are all deemed of sinister import now,

<p class="in0">or a grasshopper, possibly by reason of the
veneration in which this voracious little insect
was held by the Athenians, whose favorite
symbol it was, although it is now outlawed,
and a price set upon its head as a pest, to
be ruthlessly exterminated, by some of the
Western states. So, too, with the warning
not to kill a spider, against which, nevertheless,
the housemaid&#8217;s broom wages relentless
war. If, on the contrary, you do not kill
the first snake seen in the spring, bad luck
will follow you all the year round. Be it
ever so badly bruised, however, the belief
holds fast in the country that the reptile will
not die until sunset, or with the expiring day,</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along.&#8221;<br /></span>

<p>The peacock&#8217;s feathers were supposed to be
unlucky, from an old tradition associating its
gaudy colors with certain capital sins, which
these colors were held to symbolize. Nevertheless,
this tall and haughty feather has been
much the fashion of late years as an effective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
mantel ornament, showing how reckless some
people can be regarding the prophecy of evil.</p>

<p>Getting married before breakfast is considered
unlucky. It would be quite as logical
to say this of any other time of the day; hence
unlucky to get married at all, though it is not
believed all married people will cordially subscribe
to this heresy.</p>

<p>May is an unlucky month to be married in.

<p>Getting out of bed on the wrong side bodes
ill luck for the rest of the day. A common
remark to a person showing ill-humor is, &#8220;I
guess you got out of the wrong side of the bed
this morning.&#8221; It has in fact become a
proverb.</p>

<p>To begin dressing yourself by putting the
stocking on the left foot first would be trifling
with fortune. I know a man who would not do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
so on any account. It is also unlucky to put
a right foot into a left-hand shoe, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versa</i>.
These are necessary corollaries of the &#8220;right-foot-foremost&#8221;
superstition.</p>

<p>Cutting the finger nails on the Sabbath is a
bad omen. There is a set of rhymed rules for
the doing of even this trifling act. Apparently,
the Chinese know the omen, as they do not
cut the nails at all.</p>

<p>Of the harmless dragon-fly or devil&#8217;s darning-needle,
country girls say that if one flies in your
face it will sew up your eyes.</p>

<p>In some localities I have heard it said that if
two persons walking together should be parted
by a post, a tree, or a person, in their path,
something unlucky will surely <span class="locked">result&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">

Low, the pirate, would not let his crew work
on the Sabbath, not so much, we suppose, from
conscientious scruples, as for fear it would bring
him bad luck. The rest of the Decalogue did
not seem to bother him in the least.</p>

<p>After having once started on an errand or a
journey, it is unlucky to go back, even if you
have forgotten something of importance. All
persons afflicted with frequent lapses of memory
should govern themselves accordingly.
This belief seems clearly grounded upon the
dreadful fate of Lot&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>It was always held unlucky to break a piece
of crockery, as a second and a third piece
shortly will be broken also. This is closely
associated with the belief respecting the number
three, elsewhere referred to. In New England
it is commonly said that if you should
break something on Monday, bad luck will follow
you all the rest of the week.</p>

<p>To stumble in going upstairs is also unlucky;
perhaps to stumble at any other time. Friar
Lawrence says, in &#8220;Romeo and Juliet,&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;They stumble that run fast.&#8221;<br /></span>

Two persons washing their hands in the same
basin or in the same water will quarrel unless
the sign of the cross be made in the water.</p>

<p>It is considered unlucky to take off a ring
that was the gift of a deceased person, an engagement,
or a marriage ring.</p>

<p>The term &#8220;hoodoo,&#8221; almost unknown in the
Northern United States a few years ago, has
gradually worked its way into the vernacular,
until it is in almost everybody&#8217;s mouth. It is,
perhaps, most lavishly employed during the
base-ball season, as everyone knows who reads
the newspapers, to describe something that has
cast a spell upon the players, so bringing about
defeat. The term is then &#8220;hoodooing.&#8221; The
hoodoo may be anything particularly ugly or
repulsive seen on the way to the game&mdash;a
deformed old woman, a one-legged man, a lame
horse, or a blind beggar, for instance. Most
players are said to give full credit to the power
of the hoodoo to bewitch them. Indeed, the
term has been quite widely taken up as the
synonym for bad luck, or, rather, the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
it, even by the business world. If this is not,
to all intents, a belief in witchcraft, it certainly
comes very close to what passed for witchcraft
two hundred years ago.</p>

<p>This vagrant and ill-favored word &#8220;hoodoo&#8221;
is, again, a corruption of the voudoo of the ignorant
blacks of the South, with whom, in fact, it
stands, as some say, for witchcraft, pure and
simple, or, perhaps, the Black Art, as practised
in Africa; while others pronounce it to be a
religious rite only. More than this, the voudoo
also is a mystic order, into whose unholy mysteries
the neophyte is inducted with much barbaric
ceremony. In the case of a white woman
so initiated in Louisiana, this consisted in the
elect chanting a weird incantation, while the
novitiate, clad only in her shift, danced within a
charmed circle formed of beef bones and skeletons,
toads&#8217; feet and spiders, with camphor and
kerosene oil sprinkled about it. All those present
join in the dance to the accompaniment of
tom-toms and other rude instruments, until physical
exhaustion compels the dancers to stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
In its main features we find a certain resemblance
between the voudoo dance of the ignorant
blacks and the ghost dance practised by
some of the wild Indians of the West, and by
means of which they are wrought up to the
highest pitch of frenzy, so preparing the way
for an outbreak, such as occurred a few years
ago with most lamentable results.</p>

<p>While the sporting fraternity is notoriously
addicted to the hoodoo superstition, yet it is by
no means confined to them alone. Not long
ago a statement went the rounds of the newspapers
to the effect that the superstitious wife
of a certain well-known millionnaire had refused
to go on board of their palatial yacht because
one of the crew had been fatally injured by falling
down a hatchway. In plain English, the
accident had hoodooed the ship.</p>

<p>But the power of the hoodoo would seem not
to be limited to human beings, according to this
statement, taken from the columns of a reputable
newspaper: &#8220;A meadow at Biddeford,
Maine, is known as the hoodoo lawn, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
reason that rain follows every time it is mowed,
before the grass can be cured. It is said that
this has occurred for twenty-five consecutive
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>To break the spell of the hoodoo, it is as
essential to have a mascot, over which the
malign influence can have no power, as to
have an antidote against poisons. Therefore
most ball-players carry a mascot with them.
Sometimes it is a goat, or a dog, or again a
black sheep, that is gravely led thrice around
the field before the play begins.</p>

<p>It is not learned whether or not the different
kinds of mascot have ever been pitted
against each other. Perhaps the effect would
be not unlike that described by Cicero in his
treatise on divination. He says there that
Cato one day met a friend who seemed in a
very troubled frame of mind. On being asked
what was the matter, the friend replied: &#8220;Oh!
my friend, I fear everything. This morning
when I awoke, I saw, shall I say it? a mouse
gnawing my shoe.&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; said Cato, reassuringly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
&#8220;calm yourself. The prodigy
really would become frightful if the shoe had
been gnawing the mouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naval ships often carry a goat, or some
other animal, as a mascot, in deference to
Jack&#8217;s well-known belief in its peculiar efficacy;
and in naval parades the goat usually gravely
marches in the procession, and comes in for
his share of the applause. Simple-minded
Jack christens his favorite gun after some
favorite prize-fighter. And why not? since
the great Nelson, himself, carried a horseshoe
nailed to his mast-head, and since even some
of our college foot-ball teams bring their mascots
upon the field just like other folk.</p>

<p>The war with Spain could hardly fail of
bringing to light some notable examples of
the superstitions of sailors concerning mascots.
The destruction of Admiral Cervera&#8217;s fleet,
off Santiago de Cuba, by the American fleet,
under command of Admiral Sampson, is freshly
remembered. One of the destroyed Spanish
ships was named the <i class="ship">Colon</i>. Twenty-six days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
after the battle, the tug-boat <i class="ship">Right Arm</i> of the
Merritt-Chapman Wrecking Company visited
the <i class="ship">Colon</i>, for the purpose of raising the Spanish
cruiser. The only living thing aboard was
a black and white cat. For nearly a month it
had been the sole crew and commander of the
wrecked battle-ship.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i class="ship">Right Arm</i> took possession
of the cat, adopted it as a mascot and
named it Tomas Cervera. But Cervera brought
ill luck. When Lieutenant Hobson raised the
<i class="ship">Maria Teresa</i> the rescued cat was placed
aboard her, to be brought to America.</p>

<p>The <i class="ship">Maria Teresa</i> never reached these shores,
and when the vessel grounded off the Bahamas
the cat fell into the hands of the natives. He
was rescued the second time, and at last
reached America, a passenger on the United
States repair ship <i class="ship">Vulcan</i>.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that this cat did not
belie that article of the popular belief, which
ascribes nine lives to his tribe. But poor
Tomas Cervera did not long survive the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
hardships and perils to which he had been
subjected. He gave up the ghost shortly
after all these were happily ended.</p>

<p>Speaking of ships and sailors, it is well
known to all seafaring folk that the reputation
of a ship for being lucky, or unlucky, is
all important. And this reputation may begin
at the very moment when she leaves the stocks.
Should she, unfortunately, stick on the ways,
in launching, a bad name is pretty sure to
follow her during the remainder of her career,
and to be an important factor in her ability
to ship a crew. Even the practice of christening
a ship with a bottle of wine is neither more
nor less than a survival of pagan superstition
by which the favor of the gods was invoked.</p>

<p>The superstition regarding thirteen persons
at the table also boasts a remarkable vitality.
Just when or how it originated is uncertain.
It has been surmised, however, that the Paschal
Supper was the beginning of this notion,
for there were thirteen persons present then,
and what followed is not likely to be forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
It has, perhaps, been the subject of greater
ridicule than any other popular delusion, probably
from the fact of its touching convivial
man in his most tender part,&mdash;to wit, the
stomach. In London some of the literary and
other lights even went to the trouble of forming
a Thirteen Club for the avowed purpose
of breaking down the senseless notion that if
thirteen persons were to sit down to dinner
together, one of them would die within a twelvemonth.
The motto of this club should have
been, &#8220;All men must die, therefore all men
should dine.&#8221; If the club&#8217;s proceedings showed
no lack of invention and mother wit, we still
should very much doubt their efficacy toward
achieving the avowed end and aim of the
club&#8217;s existence, for surely such extravagances
could have no other effect than to raise a
laugh. We reproduce an account of the affair
for the reader&#8217;s <span class="locked">amusement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;At the dinner of the club, above mentioned,
there were thirteen tables, a similar number of
guests being seated at each table. The serving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of the meal was announced by the &#8220;shivering&#8221;
of a mirror placed on an easel, a ceremony performed
by two cross-eyed waiters! Having put
on green neckties and placed a miniature skeleton
in their button-holes, the guests passed
under a ladder into the dining room. The
tables were lighted with small lamps placed on
plaster skulls; skeletons were suspended from
the candles, which were thirteen in number on
each table; the knives were crossed; the salt-stands
were in the shape of coffins, with headstones
bearing the inscription, &#8216;In memory of
many senseless superstitions, killed by the
London Thirteen Club, 1894.&#8217; The salt-spoons
were shaped like a grave-digger&#8217;s spade.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the dinner was fairly started, the
chairman asked the company to spill salt with
him, and later on he invited them to break looking-glasses
with him, all of which having been
done, he presented the chairmen of the different
tables with a knife each, on condition that
nothing was given for them in return. An
undertaker, clothed in a variety costume, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
would have done credit to a first-class music
hall, was then introduced &#8216;to take orders,&#8217; but
he was quickly shuffled out of the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>These unbelieving jesters, who so audaciously
defied the fatal omen, did not seem to realize
that a popular superstition is not to be laughed
out of existence in so summary a manner.
Equally futile was the attempt to put it to a
scientific test, as, if tried by that means, it appears
that, of any group of thirteen persons, the
chances are about equal that one will die within
the year. Therefore, the attempt to break the
spell by inviting a greater number of persons
could have the effect only of increasing, rather
than diminishing, the probability of the event so
much <span class="locked">dreaded.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>

<p>It has been stated in the newspapers, from
which I take it, that there are many hotels in
New York which contain no room numbered thirteen.
There are other hotels and office buildings
wherein the rooms that are so numbered cannot
be leased except once in a great while. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
large hotels one custom is to letter the first
thirteen rooms and call them parlors. Another
custom is simply to skip the unpopular number,
and call the thirteenth room &#8220;No. 14.&#8221; A man
who had just rented an office which bears the
objectionable number, in a down-town building,
asserts that though he has no superstitious
dread of the number, he finds that others will
not transact business with him in that office. I
also find it stated as a fact that the new monster
passenger steamship <i class="ship">Oceanic</i> has no cabin or
seat at the table numbered thirteen.</p>

<p>It was again instanced as a deathblow to a
certain candidate&#8217;s hopes of a reëlection to the
United States Senate, that repeated ballotings
showed him to be just thirteen votes short of the
required number. From the same state, Pennsylvania,
comes this highly significant announcement
in regard to a base-ball team:
&#8220;Because the team left here on a very rainy day,
and on a train that pulled out from track No. 13,
the superstitious local fans (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sic</i>) are in a sad
state of mind to-night, regarding the coincidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
as an evil omen.&#8221; Again the small number of
six, in the graduating class of a certain high
school, was gravely referred to as owing to there
having originally been thirteen in that class.</p>

<p>At the same time there are exceptions which,
however, the superstitious may claim only go to
prove the rule. For instance the Thirteen Colonies
did not prove so very unlucky a venture.</p>

<p>As regards the superstitions of actors and
actresses, the following anecdote, though not
new, probably as truly reflects the state of
mind existing among the profession to-day as
it did when the incident happened to which it
refers. When the celebrated Madame Rachel
returned from Egypt in 1857, she asked
Arsène Houssaye, within a year thereafter,
the question: &#8220;Do you recollect the dinner
we had at the house of Victor Hugo? There
were thirteen of us,&mdash;Hugo and his wife, you
and your wife, Rebecca and I, Girardin and
his wife, Gerard de Nerval, Pradier, Alfred de
Musset, Perrèe, of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Siècle</i>, and the Count
d&#8217;Orsay, thirteen in all. Well, where are they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
to-day? Victor Hugo and his wife are in
Jersey, your wife is dead, Madame de Girardin
is dead, my sister Rebecca is dead, De
Nerval, Pradier, Alfred de Musset, and
d&#8217;Orsay are dead. I say no more. There
remain but Girardin and you. Adieu, my
friends. Never laugh at thirteen at a table.&#8221;</p>

<p>The world, however, especially that part of
it represented by diners out, goes on believing
in the evil augury just the same. A dinner
party is recalled at which two of the invited
guests were given seats at a side table on
account of that terrible bugbear &#8220;thirteen at
table.&#8221; When mentioning the circumstance
to a friend, he was reminded of an occasion
where an additional guest had been summoned
in haste to break the direful spell.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, the newspapers might do
much toward suppressing the spread of superstition
by refusing to print such accounts as
this, taken from a Boston daily paper, as probably
nothing is read by a certain class with
greater avidity. It says &#8220;that engine No. 13<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
of the Boston, Hoosac Tunnel &amp; Western
Railroad has, within three weeks, killed no
less than three men. The railway hands fear
the locomotive, and say that its number is
unlucky.&#8221; It is true, we understand, that the
standard number of a wrecked locomotive,
that has been in a fatal accident, is not unfrequently
changed in deference to this feeling
on the part of the engine-men.</p>

<p>It is held to be unlucky to pass underneath
a ladder, an act which indeed might be dangerous
to life or limb should the ladder fall.
But it is even harder to understand the philosophy
of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dictum</i> that to meet a squinting
woman denotes ill luck.</p>

<p>The bird was formerly accounted an unlucky
symbol, perhaps from the fact that
good fortune, like riches, is apt to take to
itself wings. The hooting of an owl, the
croaking of a raven, the cry of a whip-poor-will,
and even the sight of a solitary magpie
were always associated with malignant influences
or evil presages. Poe&#8217;s raven furnishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the theme for one of his best-known poems.
And the swan was long believed to sing her
own death-song. Be that as it may, the fact
is well remembered that a ring, bearing the
device of a bird upon it, or any other object
having the image of the feathered kind, was
not considered a suitable gift to a woman.
That article of superstition, like some others
that could be mentioned, has vanished before
the resistless command of fashion, so completely
indeed, that birds of every known
clime and plumage have since been considered
the really proper adornment for woman&#8217;s headgear.</p>

<p>There is, however, an odd superstition connected
with the magpie, an instance of which
is found related by Lord Roberts, in &#8220;Forty-one
Years in India.&#8221; We could not do better
than give it in his own words: &#8220;On the 15th
July Major Cavagnari, who had been selected
as the envoy and plenipotentiary to the Amir
of Kabul, arrived in Kuram. I, with some
fifty officers who were anxious to do honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
to the envoy and see the country beyond
Kuram, marched with Cavagnari to within
five miles of the crest of Shutargardan pass,
where we encamped, and my staff and I dined
that evening with the mission. After dinner
I was asked to propose the health of
Cavagnari and those with him, but somehow
I did not feel equal to the task: I was so
thoroughly depressed, and my mind filled with
such gloomy forebodings as to the fate of
these fine fellows, that I could not utter a
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Early next morning the Sirdar, who had
been deputed by the Amir to receive the mission,
came into camp, and soon we all started
for the top of the pass.... As we ascended,
curiously enough, we came across a solitary
magpie, which I should not have noticed had
not Cavagnari pointed it out and begged me
not to mention the fact of his having seen
it to his wife, as she would be sure to consider
it an unlucky omen.</p>

<p>&#8220;On descending to the (Afghan) camp, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
were invited to partake of dinner, served in
the Oriental fashion on a carpet spread on
the ground. Everything was done most lavishly
and gracefully. Nevertheless, I could
not feel happy as to the prospects of the mission,
and my heart sank as I wished Cavagnari
good-by. When we had proceeded a
few yards in our different directions, we both
turned round, retraced our steps, shook hands
once more, and parted forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sequel is told in the succeeding chapter.
&#8220;Between one and two o&#8217;clock on the morning
of the 5th of September, I was awakened by
my wife telling me that a telegraph man had
been wandering around the house and calling
for some time, but that no one had answered
him. The telegram told me that my worst fears
had been only too fully realized.&#8221; Cavagnari
and his party had been massacred by the
Afghans.</p>

<p>Again, there are certain things which may
not be given to a male friend (young, unmarried
ministers excepted), such, for example, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
a pair of slippers, because the recipient will be
sure, metaphorically speaking, to walk away
from the giver in them.</p>

<p>There is also current in some parts of New
England a belief that it is unlucky to get one&#8217;s
life insured, or to make one&#8217;s will, under the
delusion that doing either of these things will
tend to shorten one&#8217;s life. This feeling comes
of nothing less than a ridiculous fear of facing
even the remote probability involved in the act;
and is of a piece with the studied avoidance of
the subject of death, or willing allusion in any
way, shape, or form to the dead, even of one&#8217;s
own kith and kin, quite like that singular belief
held by the Indians which forbade any allusion
to the dead whatsoever.</p>

<p>Spilling the salt, as an omen of coming misfortune,
is one of the most widespread, as well
as one of the most deeply rooted, of popular
delusions. It is said to be universal all over
Asia, is found in some parts of Africa, and is
quite prevalent in Europe and America to-day.
Vain to deny it, the unhappy delinquent who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
is so awkward as to spill salt at the table
instantly finds all eyes turned upon him. Worse
still, the antidote once practised of flinging
three pinches of salt over the left shoulder is
no longer admissible in good society. Instantly
every one present mentally recalls the omen.
His host may politely try to laugh it off, but all
the same, a visible impression of something
unpleasant remains.</p>

<p>Something was said in another place about
the potency of the number &#8220;three&#8221; to effect
a charm either for good or for evil. Firemen
and railroad men are more or less given to the
belief that if one fire or one accident occurs, it
will inevitably be followed by two more fires or
accidents. A headline in a Boston newspaper,
now before me, reads, &#8220;The same old three
fires in succession,&#8221; and then hypocritically
exclaims, &#8220;How the superstitious point to the
recurrence!&#8221;</p>

<p>The superstition about railroad accidents is
by no means confined to the trainmen, or other
employees, but to some extent, at least, is shared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
even by the higher officials, who point to their
past experiences in the management of these
iron highways as fully establishing, to their
minds, certain conditions. One of these gentlemen
once said to me, after a bad accident
on his road, &#8220;It is not so much this one particular
accident that we dread, as what is coming
after it.&#8221; I also knew of a conductor who
asked for a leave of absence immediately after
the occurrence of a shocking wreck on the
line.</p>

<p>Although periodically confronted with a long
series of most momentous events in the world&#8217;s
history that have happened on that day of
the week, the superstition in regard to Friday,
as being an unlucky day, has so far withstood
every assault. It will not down. Whether it
exists to so great an extent as formerly may
be questioned, but that it does exist in full
force, more especially among sailors, is certain.
We have it on good authority that this self-tormenting
delusion grew out of the fact that
the Saviour was crucified on Friday, ever after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
stigmatized as &#8220;hangman&#8217;s day,&#8221; and, therefore,
set apart for the execution of criminals,
now as before time.</p>

<p>It is not wholly improbable that some share
of the odium resting upon Friday may arise
from the fact of its being so regularly observed
as a day of fasting, or at least <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maigre</i>,
by some religionists.</p>

<p>In some old diaries are found entries like the
following: &#8220;A vessel lost going out of Portland
against the advice of all; all on board,
twenty-seven, drowned.&#8221; It is easy to understand
how such an event would leave an indelible
impression upon the minds of a whole
generation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the belief is openly scouted
from the pulpit, and is even boldly defied by
a few unbelieving sea-captains, the fact remains
that there are very many sober-minded persons
who could not be induced on any account to
begin a journey on Friday. There are others
who will not embark in any new enterprise, or
begin a new piece of work on that day; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
still others who even go so far as to say that
you must not cut your nails on Friday. A man
could be named who could not be tempted to
close a bargain on any other day of the week
than Thursday. It is a further fact, which all
connected with operating railroads will readily
confirm, that Friday is always the day of least
travel on their lines. This circumstance alone
seems conclusive as to the state of popular
feeling. Apparently a brand has been set
upon the sixth day of the week for all time.</p>

<p>Numerous instances might be given to show
that men of the strongest intellect are as fallible
in this respect as men of the lowest; but
one such will suffice. Lord Byron once refused
to be introduced to a lady because it was Friday;
and on this same ill-starred day he would
never pay a visit.</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;See the moon through the glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You&#8217;ll have trouble while it lasts.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This warning couplet is still a household
word in many parts of New England. It has
been observed that even those sceptical persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
who profess to put no faith in it whatever, generally
take good care to keep on the right side
of the window-glass. As bearing upon this
branch of the general subject an incident is
related by a reputable authority, as having
occurred at a party given, not many years ago,
by a gentleman holding a considerable station
in life. It is therefore repeated here word for
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the midst of a social chat, at the close of
the day, a footman rather briskly entered the
drawing-room, and walked up to the back of
the chair of the hostess and whispered something
in her ear; she immediately closed her
eyes and gave her hand to the man, and was
forthwith led by him from the room. The
guests were rather astonished, but after the
lapse of a few moments the lady returned and
resumed her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her sudden departure having occasioned a
rather uneasy pause in the conversation, she
felt it necessary to state the cause of her singular
conduct. She then told us that the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Harvest Moon had just made its appearance,
and it was her custom to give a crown to any
of her servants that first brought the information
to her when that event occurred; and that
the reason why she closed her eyes, and was
led by the footman out of the room to the open
air, was that she might avoid the evil consequences
that were sure to happen to her if she
obtained her first glimpse of the Harvest Moon
through a pane of glass. This lady was highly
accomplished, and possessed remarkable sagacity
upon most subjects, but was nevertheless
a slave to a groundless fear of evil befalling her
if she saw this particular New Moon in any
other way than in the open air.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is passing strange, however, that the
gentle and beautiful Queen of the Night
should have been mostly associated with a
malignant influence. Juliet pleads with Romeo
not to swear by the &#8220;inconstant moon.&#8221; The
traditional witch gathers her simples only by
the light of the moon, as at no other time do
they possess the same virtues to work miraculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
cures or potent spells. It is also an old
belief that if a person goes to sleep with the
moonbeams shining full upon his uncovered
face, he will be moonstruck, or become an
idiot. I well remember to have seen the officer
of the watch awaken a number of sleepers, who
had taken refuge on the deck of a vessel from
the stifling heat below. Milton speaks of</p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i6">&#8220;Moping melancholy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moonstruck madness,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">which has become incorporated with the language
under the significant nickname of
&#8220;luny.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we consider the already long list of
material or immaterial objects threatening us
with dire misfortune, the wonder is how poor
humanity should have survived so many dangers
ever impending over it like the sword of
Damocles. Really, we seem &#8220;walking between
life and death.&#8221; The catalogue is, however, by
no means exhausted. A picture, particularly if
it be a family portrait, falling down from the
wall, bodes a death in the family, or at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
some great misfortune. This incident, somewhat
startling, it must be confessed, to weak
nerves, has been quite effectively used in
fiction.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding it is the national color of
Ireland, green has the name of being unlucky.
More strange still is the statement made by
Mr. Parnell&#8217;s biographer that the famous Irish
leader could not bear the sight of green.
Queer notion this, in a son of the Emerald
Isle! Mr. Barry O&#8217;Brien goes on to say that
Parnell &#8220;would not pass another person on the
stairs; was horror-stricken to find himself sitting
with three lighted candles; that the fall of
a picture in a room made him dejected for the
entire afternoon; and that he would have nothing
to say to an important bill, drawn up by a
colleague, because it happened to contain thirteen
clauses.&#8221; It is added that the sight of
green banners, at the political meetings he
addressed, often unnerved him.</p>

<p>The singular actions of a pet cat have
recently gained wide currency and wider comment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
in connection with the ill-fated steamer
Portland, which went down with all on board,
during the great gale of November 27, 1898.
Not a soul was left to tell the tale. It was
remarked that puss came off the boat before
the regular hour for sailing had arrived, and
though she had never before been known to
miss a trip, she could not be called or coaxed
back on board, and the doomed craft therefore
sailed without her. As a matter of fact, it has
been noticed that in times of great disasters,
like that just related, superstition that has lain
dormant for a time, always shows a new vigor,
and finds a new reason for being.</p>

<p>In the course of my rambles along the New
England coast, I found many people holding to
beliefs of one sort or another, who hotly resented
the mere suggestion that they were superstitious.
The quaint and curious delusions which
have become ingrained in their lives from generation
to generation, they do not regard in
that light. For one thing they believe that if a
dead body should remain in the house over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Sunday, there will be another death in the
family before the year is out.</p>

<p>The ticking of the death-watch, once believed
to forebode the approaching dissolution of some
member of the family, so terrifying to our fathers
and mothers, is now, fortunately, seldom
heard or little regarded. While the superstition
did prevail, there was nothing so calculated
to strike terror to the very marrow of the
appalled listeners as the noise of this harmless
little beetle, only a quarter of an inch long,
tapping away in the decaying woodwork of an
ancient wainscot.</p>

<p>There is no end of legendary matter concerning
clocks. Sometimes nervous people have
been frightened half out of their wits at hearing
a clock that had stopped, suddenly strike the
hour. Clocks have been known to stop, too,
at the exact hour when a death took place in
the house. But even more startling was an
instance, lately vouched for by reputable witnesses,
of a clock, of the coffin pattern, of
course, from which the works had been removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
playing this same grewsome trick. The first
case might be accounted for, rationally, by some
fault in the mechanism, or some rusty spring
suddenly set in motion; but all theories necessarily
fail with clocks without works. Admonitions
or warnings are often associated with
clocks, as has been noticed in connection with
marriage customs. And the mystical relation
between time and eternity is often brought to
mind by the stopping of the watch in a drowned
person&#8217;s pocket, or the relation of some curious
legend like the following, without comment or
qualification, in a reputable <span class="locked">newspaper:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;There is a curious legend about the old
clock, which is to be superseded by a new one,
at Washington, Pennsylvania. It is stated that
about twenty years ago a person was hung in
the courtyard. The clock, which had always
tolled out the hour regularly, stopped at the
hour of two o&#8217;clock, being the hour at which
the drop fell that sent the unfortunate into
eternity. Since that time, many aver, the clock
has never struck again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
So, also, the howling of a dog, either by day
or by night, under a sick person&#8217;s window, is to
this day held by the weak-minded to portend
the death of that person. Some writers think
they have traced this belief to the symbolism
of ancient mythology, where the dog stands for
the howling night-wind, on which the souls of
the dead rode to the banks of the Styx, but this
hypothesis seems quite far-fetched.</p>

<p>The winding-sheet in the candle is another
self-tormenting belief of evil portent, now happily
gone out with the candle.</p>

<p>Then again, to pass from this subject, a
single case of nosebleed often excites the liveliest
fears on the part of nervous people, on
account of a very old belief that it was a sure
omen of a death taking place in the family.
Not long ago the following choice morsel met
my eye while reading in a book: &#8220;Our steward
has this moment lost a drop of blood, which
involuntarily fell from his pug nose. &#8216;There,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;I have lost my mother&mdash;a good
friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Breaking a looking-glass denotes that a death
will take place in the family within the year.
This mode of self-torture is supposed to derive
its origin from the great use formerly made of
mirrors by magicians and other obsolete impostors
in carrying on their mystical trade.
Astrologers also made use of the looking-glass
in practising the art of divination or foretelling
events, probably by means of some such cunning
contrivances as are now employed with
startling effects by our own &#8220;wizards&#8221; and
&#8220;necromancers.&#8221; Quite naturally the innocent
glass itself came to be looked upon by the
ignorant with superstitious awe, and the breaking
of one as the sure forerunner of calamity.
We do not think, however, that this old superstition
is by any means as widely prevalent as it
once was.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to chronicle the total disappearance
of that terrible bugaboo, the Evil Eye,
which so long kept our ancestors in a state of
nervous apprehension fearful to contemplate.
It is now only perpetuated by a saying. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
with that other equally repulsive belief in the
efficacy of touching a dead body, as a means of
convicting a suspected murderer by the fresh
bleeding from the wound. Both of these superstitions
were fully accepted by the first settlers
of New England, and perhaps also in other of
the colonies. John Winthrop relates a very
harrowing case of infanticide, in which this
monstrous test was put in practice to convict
the erring <span class="locked">mother.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> The superstition is said to
be of German origin.</p>

<p>The following very curious piece of superstition
is found in Colonel May&#8217;s Journal of his
trip to the Ohio, early in the century. It
seems that a man had fallen into the river
and was drowned before help could reach him.
The following method was employed to recover
the body. First they took the shirt which the
drowned man had last worn, put a whole loaf
of good, new bread, weighing four pounds, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
it, and tied it up carefully into a bundle. The
bundle was then taken in a boat to the place
where the man had fallen in, a line and tackle
attached to it, and then set afloat on the water.
The rescuers said that the bread would float
until it should come directly over the body,
when it would sink and thus discover the location
of the dead man. Unfortunately, the line
was not long enough, so that when the loaf
filled with water and sank, the tackle disappeared

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">Haunted</span> houses have proved an insuperable
stumbling-block to those wiseacres
who no sooner insist that superstition has
died out than the familiar headline in the daily
paper, &#8220;A haunted house,&#8221; stares them full in
the face. It is believed that many such houses
stand tenantless to-day because of the secret
fear they inspire in the minds of the timid or
superstitious, who, quite naturally, shrink from
living under the same roof with disembodied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
spirits. It has already been noted that M.
Camille Flammarion is a firm believer in
haunted houses. Here is what he has to say
upon that much debated <span class="locked">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;There is no longer any room to doubt the
fact that certain houses are haunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I began the scientific studies of these questions
on November 15, 1861, and I have continued
it ever since. I have received more than
four thousand letters upon these questions from
the learned men of every land, and I am glad
to be able to say that some of the most interesting
letters come from America.&#8221;</p>

<p>For every haunted house there must, of
course, be an invisible intruder who comes
only in the small hours, when the effects of
its unwelcome presence would, of course, be
most terrifying to weak nerves. But it is to
be remarked that we hear nothing nowadays
of the old-time, hair-raising, blood-curdling
ghost whose coming forebode something terrible
about to happen, or who had some awful
revelation to make. That type of ghost has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
passed away. The modern ghost never makes
set speeches in a sepulchral voice or leaves a
palpable smell of brimstone behind. It comes
rather in a spirit of mischief-making, shown in
such petty annoyances as setting the house bells
ringing, overturning articles of furniture, twitching
the bedclothes from off a sleeping person in
the coldest of cold nights, putting out the lights,
or making a horrible racket, first in one room,
then in another, as if it revelled in pure wantonness
of purpose. In short, there is no limit
to the ingenious deviltries perpetrated by this
nocturnal disturber of domestic peace and
quiet.</p>

<p>After two or three sleepless nights, followed
by days of quaking apprehension, the occupants
usually move out, declaring that they
would not live in the house if it were given
to them. And so it stands vacant indefinitely,
shunned by all to whom its evil reputation has
become known, a visible monument of active
superstition.</p>

<p>That all these things have happened as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
lately as in this year of grace (1900) is too
well known to be denied. And as most people
would desire to shun publicity in such a matter,
there are probably very many cases that never
reach the public eye at all. One such is reported
of a family at Charlestown, Massachusetts,
being disturbed by strange noises, as of
some one pounding on the walls or floors at
all hours of the night. Even the police, when
summoned, failed to lay hands on the invisible
tormentor, who, like the ghost in Hamlet,
was here, there, and nowhere in a jiffy.</p>

<p>One of the most singular cases that have
come to my knowledge, perhaps because the
unaccountable disturbances happened in the
daytime, whereas they habitually occur only in
the night-time, when churchyards are supposed
to yawn, was that of a haunted schoolhouse.
This was downright bravado. If we do not err,
in this case a bell was repeatedly rung during
the regular sessions, by no visible agency, to
the amazement of both teachers and scholars.
After a vain search for the cause, the schoolhouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
was shut up, and so remained for a considerable
time, a speechless but tangible witness
to the general belief that the devil was at the
bottom of it all.</p>

<p>Not many generations ago, when ghosts were
perhaps more numerous than at present, there
were professional exorcists who could be hired
to clear the premises of ghosts or no pay; but
this is now a lost art. As Shakespeare <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;No exorciser harm thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor no witchcraft charm thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghost unlaid forbear thee!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While upon this interesting subject it may be
instructive to know what our ancestors sometimes
suffered from similar visitations. We
take the following extract from Ben Franklin&#8217;s
<cite>New England Courant</cite>, of 1726:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;They write from Plymouth, that an extraordinary
event has lately happened in that neighborhood,
in which, some say, the Devil and the
man of the house are very much to blame.
The man it seems, would now and then in a
frolic call upon the Devil to come down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
chimney; and some little time after the last invitation,
the goodwife&#8217;s pudding turned black in
the boiling, which she attributed to the Devil&#8217;s
descending the chimney, and getting into the
pot upon her husband&#8217;s repeated wishes for
him. Great numbers of people have been to
view the pudding, and to inquire into the circumstances;
and most of them agree that so
sudden a change must be produced by a preternatural
power. However, &#8217;tis thought it will
have this good effect upon the man, that he will
no more be so free with the Devil in his cups,
lest his Satanic Majesty should again unluckily
tumble into the pot.&#8221;</p>

<p>But houses are by no means the only things
subject to these astounding visitations. Dark
and secluded ponds, thick swamps, and barren
hillsides often bear that unsavory reputation
to-day, it may be from association with some
weird tale or legend, or mayhap because such
places seldom fail, of themselves, to produce a
certain effect upon an active imagination. Let
any such person, who has ever been lost in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
thick forest, recall his sensations upon first
making the unwelcome discovery. The solemn
old woods then seem all alive <span class="locked">with&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;The dim and shadowy armies of our unquiet dreams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their footsteps brush the dewy fern and print the shaded streams.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As regards haunted ships, the following incident,
taken down as literally as I could transcribe
it at the time, from the lips of a seafaring
friend, speaks for <span class="locked">itself:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Twas some dozen year ago, may be less,
may be more&mdash;beats all how time travels when
you&#8217;ve turned the half-century post&mdash;I was
aboard of the old <i class="ship">Paul Pry</i>&mdash;queer name, now,
warn&#8217;t it? We was a lyin&#8217; in Havana harbor,
all snug, about a mile from shore. Well, the
mate he was on watch. In port, you know,
ships always keep slack watch. Our&#8217;n was light,
nothin&#8217; in her, hold all swep&#8217; out clean that very
day, &#8217;cause we was to begin takin&#8217; in sugar and
molasses in the mornin&#8217;. All hands were off in
the ship&#8217;s boat visitin&#8217; another ship&mdash;all &#8217;cept
the steward. The old man, he was ashore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m slow, but you just hold your hosses.
All to once&#8217;t the mate thought he heern somebody
walkin&#8217; back&#8217;ards and for&#8217;ards plumb down
in the hold. He walked to the open hatch and
called down, &#8216;Who&#8217;s there?&#8217; No answer. He
listened. No sound. Thinkin&#8217; it might possibly
have been the steward getting his firewood,
the mate went for&#8217;ard to the steward&#8217;s room to
see if it was so, and found him fast asleep in his
bunk. That settled it. Nobody aboard but
them two.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mate he said nothin&#8217; to nobody, but got
a lantern and slipped quietly down the ladder
into the hold, determined to find out who was
skylarkin&#8217; there, for I tell you the mate he was
a game one all the time, and don&#8217;t you b&#8217;leeve
he warn&#8217;t!</p>

<p>&#8220;He hunted high and low, from the fore-peak
to the run, but not a soul was to be seen
anywhere; but just as soon as he stood still
he would hear those myster&#8217;ous footsteps go
trampin&#8217; fore and aft, fore and aft, as plain as
day, right by him, where he stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
&#8220;By this time the mate had got pretty well
worked up, I want you to know, so he just gin
one kinder skeered look around him, and then
hustled himself off up that ladder just a leetle
mite faster than he came down, wonderin&#8217; to
himself what it all could mean, and thinkin&#8217; all
sorts of things to once&#8217;t.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he went and woke up the steward, and
both on &#8217;em went and listened fust at one hatch,
then at t&#8217;other, and sure enough that consarned
tramp, tramp, tramp, was a-goin&#8217; on agin just
the same as before. Then they pulled on the
hatches. But, Lor&#8217; bless you, it warn&#8217;t no use.
Them critters down below had the bulge on &#8217;em
every time.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mate he said nothin&#8217; &#8217;cept to the old
man, who looked as black as a new-painted
deadeye with the lanyards unrove when he
heerd it; but somehow it leaked out among the
crew before we sailed, and one or two ran away
and laid low till the ship was clean out of the
harbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was gen&#8217;lly b&#8217;leeved fore and aft that them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
there footsteps was a warnin&#8217;. Hows&#8217;ever, the
thing quieted down some in a day or two, so
nothin&#8217; more was heerd of the walkin&#8217; match
down below; but on the third day out, I think
it was, we was struck by one of them northers,
and in spite of all we could do we was drove
ashore on a reef off the Bermudys, where the
<i class="ship">Paul Pry</i> brought up all standin&#8217;, and there she
left her old bones. The wreckers they came
and took off the crew, and fetched &#8217;em all safe
into Nassau. Now if that ship warn&#8217;t haunted,
I miss my guess. You can&#8217;t most always tell
about them things, I know; but ef it was skylarkin&#8217;,
all I&#8217;ve got to say is, it was a purty neat
job, and don&#8217;t you forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are also places, as well as houses,
which have the reputation of being haunted,
sometimes through the commission of a horrible
crime in that particular locality, sometimes
through the survival of some obscure
local tradition. It matters not. Once give the
place a bad name, and local tradition preserves
the memory of it for many generations. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
schoolboy is familiar with the weird legend of
Nix&#8217;s Mate, a submerged island at the entrance
to Boston Harbor, where pirates were formerly
hung in chains. Appledore Island, on the
coast of New Hampshire, once had the name
of being haunted by the uneasy ghost of one
of Captain Kidd&#8217;s piratical crew. The face of
the spectre was said by those who had seen it,
or who thought they had seen it, to be dreadful
to behold, and the neck to bear the livid mark
of the hangman&#8217;s noose. Once, no islander
could be found hardy enough to venture himself
on Appledore after dark. Indeed, such places
of fearsome reputation are found all over New
England. For example, there is the shrieking
woman of Marblehead, a remarkable spook,
who at certain intervals of time could be heard
uttering the most heartrending cries for mercy
to her inhuman murderers. Then, again, there
is the legend of Harry Main, reputed pirate and
wrecker, who, by means of false lights, decoyed
simple mariners to destruction on the shoals of
Ipswich Bar, to which for his many crimes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
wretch was doomed to be chained down to the
fatal spot to which he had lured his unsuspecting
<span class="locked">victims.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span></p>

<p>Quite naturally these legends mostly cluster
about the seacoast, but now and then one is
found in the interior. One corner of the town
of Chester, New Hampshire, lifts into view an
eminence known as Rattlesnake Hill, one rocky
side of which is pierced entirely through, thus
forming a cavern of great notoriety in all the
country round. This cavern is known as the
Devil&#8217;s Den, and many were the frightful
stories told around winter firesides of the
demons who, of yore, haunted it, and who, all
unseen of mortal eyes, there held their midnight
orgies within the gloomy recesses of the
mountain.</p>

<p>There are two entrances to this cavern, both
leading to an interior, subterranean chamber,
whose vaulted roof is thickly studded with
pear-shaped protuberances that are said to
shine and sparkle when the flame of a torch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
sheds a ruddy glow upon them. According to
popular tradition the path leading to the cavern
was always kept open, summer and winter.
Many years ago the poet Whittier put the
legend into <span class="locked">verse:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;&#8217;Tis said that this cave is an evil place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chosen haunt of a fallen race&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the midnight traveller oft hath seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A red flame tremble its jaws between,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lighten and quiver the boughs among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the fiery play of a serpent&#8217;s tongue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sounds of fear from its chambers swell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghostly gibber,&mdash;the fiendish yell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bodiless hands at the entrance wave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hence they have named it the Demon&#8217;s Cave.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The persistent life of such local traditions as
these fully attests to the belief of former generations
of men in the active agency of the Evil
One in human affairs. And not only this, but
this omnipresent devil has actually left his
mark, legibly stamped, in so many places, and
his name in so many others, that to doubt his
actual presence were not only unreasonable but
ungenerous. Even his footprints are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
here and there, yet strange to say, few represent
a cloven foot. The sonorous names,
Devil&#8217;s Pulpit and Devil&#8217;s Cartway, are found
within a few miles of each other on the coast
of Maine. Moreover, do we not know from a
perusal of the testimony given at the celebrated
witchcraft trials, that the arch-fiend had been
both seen and spoken with <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in propria persona</i>?</p>

<p>It used to be a not uncommon threat with
quick-tempered people to say that if their
wishes or expectations were not gratified to
their liking, they would &#8220;haunt you&#8221; when
they died. I myself have often heard this
expression used either in jest or in earnest;
and when used it never failed to leave a disagreeable
impression on the listener.</p>

<p>It is not a great many years ago since an
account was telegraphed all over the country,
and duly appeared in the daily newspapers, of
an honest citizen, a resident of one of the largest
towns in Pennsylvania, whose wife &#8220;while
yet in good health, frequently admonished her
friends that she did not wish her body to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
buried in a certain wet graveyard. She threatened
to &#8216;speak to them&#8217; if her wish was not
granted, and went so far as to tell them how
she would haunt them by coming back in
ghostly form. The wife died, and her body
was buried in the graveyard she had disliked.
Now, strange as it may appear, her husband
alleges that, since the funeral took place, she
has appeared at his bedside several times each
week, always looking at him, and always making
motions with her bony hands, as a mark of
her displeasure. The husband says he is unable
to sleep, and also that he is sure the strange
midnight visitor is none other than his wife.
He declares that whatever other people may
think of it, he himself firmly believes that he
has brought the enmity of the spirit upon himself
and children by their refusal to grant the
wife&#8217;s last request. The children&#8217;s beds are
also visited by her, as they say, and as a consequence
the family is kept in constant alarm.
One of the nearest neighbors has also seen the
&#8216;spook&#8217; several times, and corroborates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
family in every particular. The terrified husband
relates the facts himself, and it is the
responsibility of the man that warrants publishing
his story of the appearance of the
spook. He gives the account of the strange
happenings in a straightforward manner, which
impresses a person with its truth, and he further
says it is not imagination, a dream, or an
attack of nightmare, but that the spook always
comes when he is wide awake. The women
and children of the neighborhood are in great
terror, and the people hardly venture out of
doors after dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon the heels of this experience comes the
following telegram to the Associated Press,
thus disseminating, through its thousand channels,
superstition <span class="locked">broadcast:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">[&#8220;Copyright, 1899, by The Associated Press.]</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">London</span>, March 4, 1899. Another link in
the chain of illfortune which has followed
the famous Newstead Abbey was forged this
week. It seems that a curse rests on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
abbey, and that the eldest has never succeeded
to the estate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Byron sold it to Col. Wildman in 1808, who
died childless. The trustees sold it to Webb,
the famous sportsman, whose eldest son died
this week. Byron had the skull which was
reported to have belonged to the ghost that
haunted the abbey, and he used it as a punch
bowl. Webb buried the skull, hoping to lay
the ghost.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>As related to the general subject, it is too
well known that certain persons to-day profess
the power of conversing with disembodied
spirits, to need more than a passing reference
to this particular form of belief, which some
hold to as firmly as to an article of religious
faith, while others consider it a delusion or
worse. Forty odd years ago spirit rappings
convulsed society from one end of the country
to the other. Spiritual séances were vehemently
denounced from the pulpit, and while
fully reported also by the press, the mediums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
were charged with being rank impostors, humbugs,
and the like. Alleged exposure followed
exposure. Yet somehow the belief, such as it
is, has contrived to outlive ridicule, calumny,
and persecution&mdash;the common lot of every
new and startling departure from the older
beliefs&mdash;until to-day it has acquired not only
the right to live, but also that of calm discussion.</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Johnson once asked the pertinent
question, &#8220;If moral evil be consistent with the
government of the Deity, why may not physical
evil be consistent with it?&#8221; The solemn declaration
that the sins of the fathers shall be visited
upon the children unto the third and fourth
generations, sometimes recurs to us with startling
force, more especially when the awful
anathema is brought so near home to us as it is
by the following veracious <span class="locked">incident.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span></p>

<p>There is a certain well-known locality in
Essex County, Massachusetts, which has long
borne the evil reputation of being haunted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
owing to the tradition that a cruel murder was
committed there. According to some of the
old people from whom I had the story, strange
sights and sounds have been both seen and
heard near the spot where the crime took place.
For instance, a child would be heard crying out
most pitifully, though nothing could be seen.
One belated horseman positively declared that
when passing this accursed place he had seen
a child&#8217;s coffin moving along the road, as
he moved; and that the spectre followed
him almost into the town of Ipswich. It is
said to be a fact that many of the old folks
were afraid to pass this place of dread after
dark.</p>

<p>As to the origin of the story, with its highly
dramatic features, accounts differ somewhat;
but considerable pains have been taken to arrive
at the truth, since it is a matter of general notoriety
in the neighborhood referred to, although
the actual facts may have no relation whatever
to the &#8220;skeleton in the closet&#8221; disclosed by the
story itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
The story goes back to colonial times, and
chiefly has to do with the two daughters of a
family in good social standing. These young
women had for a serving-maid a negro slave,
who was treated with marked severity by her
haughty mistresses.</p>

<p>In time, the slave woman bore a child.
Angered at the coming of the luckless little
waif, the cruel sisters resolved to put it out of
the way. One day the mother found it hid
away in a hogshead of flax, in the garret. Failing
in this attempt, the sisters then took the
child, stuck pins into its veins, and tried to
smother it between two feather beds. When
the infant was thought to be quite dead, the
body was thrown into a brook, under a nearby
bridge which spanned it. Life, however, was
not quite extinct, so that the child&#8217;s cries were
heard by a passing traveller, who rescued it, but
it soon after bled to death from the wounds
inflicted upon it.</p>

<p>Half crazed by this dastardly act, the forlorn
mother then and there called down the curse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
God upon the inhuman sisters and their sons to
all future generations.</p>

<p>This is substantially the legend. Now for
the sequel. It is said to be a fact that all the
sons of the daughters of that family, and no
others, have ever since been afflicted with a
strange and incurable malady, the principal
feature being a tendency to profuse bleeding
from the most trifling cuts or wounds. After
some days have elapsed, a mere scratch will
begin to bleed copiously and so continue until
the sufferer has lost so much blood that in some
cases it is said he has bled to death. From
this circumstance the persons so afflicted are
known by the name of &#8220;bleeders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Felt asserts that the family in which this
singular hemorrhage first appeared brought it
with them from England; which, if true, would
summarily dispose of the legend; but his statement
does not accord with the story as told on
the spot. It is here related as it was told to
me.</p>

<p>Reference was earlier made to the old-time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
respectable ghost of our fathers, who like the
ghost in Hamlet, made his unwelcome appearance
only to subserve the ends of justice. This
practical generation hardly realizes, we think,
how lately the ghost was accepted in that character,
or how trustworthy his evidence was
deemed by the purveyors of public intelligence.
On turning over the files of the <cite>New England
Weekly Journal</cite> of December 1, 1729, we came
across the following ghost story, here reproduced
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">verbatim</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last week, one belonging to Ipswich came
to Boston and related that some time since he
was at Canso in Nova Scotia, and that on a
certain day there appeared to him an apparition
in blood and wounds, and told him that at
such a time and place, mentioning both, he
was barbarously murdered by one, who was at
Rhode Island, and desired him to go to the
said person and charge him with the said murder,
and prosecute him therefor, naming several
circumstances relating to the murder; and
that since his arrival from Canso to Ipswich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
the said apparition had appeared to him again,
and urged him immediately to prosecute the
said affair. The abovesaid person having
related the matter was advised and encouraged
to go to Rhode Island and engage
therein, and he accordingly set out for that
place on Thursday last.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>Dr. Timothy Dwight, in his &#8220;Travels,&#8221; records,
with approval, the following singular
superstition relative to the barberry, which is
so common in New England. &#8220;This bush,&#8221;
he remarks, &#8220;is, in New England, generally
believed to blast both wheat and rye. Its
blossoms, which are very numerous, and continue
a considerable time, emit very copiously
a pungent effluvium believed to be so acrimonious
as to injure essentially both these kinds of
grain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;In Southborough, a township in the county
of Worcester, a Mr. Johnson sowed with rye
a field of new ground. At the south end of
this field also grew a single barberry bush.
The grain was blasted throughout the whole
length of the field, on a narrow tract commencing
at the bush and proceeding directly
in the course, and to the extent, to which the
blossoms were diffused by the wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Certes, that was a most extraordinary belief
held by the simple country folk in a
certain quiet corner of New England, that
candles made of the tallow obtained from a
dead body, would, when lighted, render the
person carrying them invisible; and furthermore
that a lighted candle of this description,
if placed within a bedroom, would effectually
prevent a sleeping person from waking until
it should be extinguished. This I had from
the lips of a most intelligent and estimable
lady, who knew whereof she spoke.</p>

<p>I confess that on hearing this statement I
realized that I had now found more than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
was looking for. But incredible as it may
seem at first, all doubts were set at rest by the
following article found among some fragments
of old superstition in a certain treatise on that
subject. Here is the article <span class="locked">verbatim:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The Hand of Glory is a piece of foreign
superstition common in France, Germany, and
Spain; and is a charm used by housebreakers
and assassins. It is the hand of a hanged man,
holding a candle made of the fat of a hanged
man, virgin wax, and siasme of Lapland. It
stupefies those to whom it is presented, and
renders them motionless, insomuch that they
could not stir, any more than if they were
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not find any recent mention of the
appearance of that ancient bugbear known as
the Will-o&#8217;-the-wisp, or magical Jack-o&#8217;-lantern,
associated with the unearthly light sometimes
seen flitting about ancient graveyards. Science
has practically accounted for this natural
phenomenon to the general acceptance; but
science has not yet been able to do away with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the instinctive dread with which the vicinity
of a graveyard is associated in most minds. I
well remember how, when a lad, I dreaded to
pass a graveyard after dark. There was a
sickly feeling of something lurking among
those ghostly looking tombstones. I looked
another way. I whistled, I looked behind me.
Vain effort! I ran from the spot as if all the
ghosts my fears had conjured up were close
at my heels.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">We</span> approach a still different class of
evil omens, or such as are believed by
many to &#8220;cast their shadows before,&#8221; in such
a manner as to prey upon the spirits, or
show their visible effects in the daily actions
of men, usually well balanced, with a feeling
akin to respectful fear. Let other forms of
superstition be never so mirth-provoking, the
reality of this one, at least to those of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
imaginative or highly impressible nature, is
such that we are sobered at once. What
concerns such momentous events as life and
death is really no jesting matter.</p>

<p>There may be, probably is, a scientific explanation
for those fancies that sometimes
come over us, with a sinking feeling at the
heart. Men usually keep silent. Women
more often give utterance to their feelings.
How many times have we heard this remark:
&#8220;O dear, I feel as if something was going
to happen!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is still another phase of the subject.
Probably hundreds, perhaps thousands, could
be found, who, at some time or other, have
passed through some strange experience, which
they are wholly unable to account for on any
rational theory or ground whatever. Perhaps
it has been to the inner man what the skeleton
in the closet is to the family home.
Unfortunately, it is only in moments when
men lay bare their inmost thoughts to each
other that these things, so valuable from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
standpoint of psychology, leak out. What
is, then, the secret power, which, in our waking
hours, our sober consciousness, is able to
oppress our spirits like some hideous nightmare?
In its nature it seems most often a
warning of coming evil or future event,&mdash;in
fact, an omen of which we obtain the knowledge
by accident, or without design or premeditation.
Were it not for the fear of
ridicule, we are persuaded that a multitude
of persons could testify to some very interesting
phenomena of this kind, drawn from their
own experiences.</p>

<p>There was a woman whom I knew very well,
in a little seaport of Maine, a respectable,
middle-aged matron, who asserted that no one
ever died in that village unless she had a warning.
Precisely what the nature of that warning
was she would never divulge; but it is nevertheless
a fact that she was often consulted
by her neighbors when any one was taken
seriously ill, and that her oracular dictum
received full and entire credit among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
In that same little seaport the superstition is
current that a sick person will not die till
ebb tide. As that goes out, so does the life.
This particular article of superstitious faith
still holds in some parts of England, we
understand, and is made use of by Dickens
in &#8220;David Copperfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following incident came to my knowledge
while I was in the near neighborhood
of the place where a recent shocking railroad
accident had happened. Naturally, it was the
one topic of conversation, far and near. The
engine-man, an old and trusted servant of
the company, went down with his engine in
the wreck. While being dug out from under
his engine, crushed and bleeding, the poor
fellow said to his rescuers: &#8220;Three times I&#8217;ve
seen a man on the track at this very place,
and three times I&#8217;ve stopped my engine. I
said this morning that I wouldn&#8217;t go over the
road again; but couldn&#8217;t get any one to take
my place, and here I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>That a sinister presentiment should cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
one in moments of extreme peril, may be
easily conceived, but why it should occur, and
does occur, at times when no known danger
threatens, or any mental or physical condition
would seem to warrant it, is not so easily
understood. Yet history is full of such examples,
related, too, not of the weaker sort,
but of the strongest characters. Mr. Motley,
in his &#8220;John of Barneveld,&#8221; gives a vivid
picture of Henry IV. of France just before
his death. The great monarch was on the
point of departure, at the head of the best
appointed army he had ever commanded, for
the war against Spain. &#8220;But he delayed for a
few days to take part in the public festivities
in honor of the coronation of his queen.
These festivities he dreaded, and looked forward
to them with gloomy forebodings. He
was haunted with fears that they involved his
own life, and that he should not survive
them. He said many times to his favorite
minister, Sully: &#8216;I know not how it is, but
my heart tells me that some misfortune is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
befall me. I shall never go out of it.&#8217; He
had dreams, also, which assumed to him the
force of revelations, that he was to die in a
carriage, and at the first magnificent festival
he gave. Sully asked him why he did not
abandon the proposed festivities at the coronation,
and actually went to the queen to persuade
her to countermand them. But she
refused in high indignation, being, as is now
supposed, in the conspiracy against his life.
The result is well known: the king was
assassinated in his carriage by Ravaillac, as
the festivities were in progress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every one remembers the curious incident
in regard to Lord Thomas Lyttleton&#8217;s vision, as
related in Boswell&#8217;s &#8220;Johnson,&#8221; predicting the
time of his death, and its exact fulfilment;
and Johnson&#8217;s solemn comments thereon. &#8220;It
is the most extraordinary thing that has happened
in my day. I heard it with my own
ears from his uncle, Lord Westcote.&#8221; Lord
Byron once observed that several remarkable
things had happened on his birthday, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
also had to Napoleon. Marie Antoinette, too,
was a firm believer in these presentiments.
She thus declares herself in language that
now seems prophetic: &#8220;At my wedding something
whispered to me that I was signing my
death warrant. At the last moment I would
have retreated if I could have done so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our early New England historian, Winthrop,
mentions a singular case of presentiment of
death, experienced by one Baker, of Salem.
This man, on going forth to his work, in the
morning, told his wife he should never see
her more. He was killed by a stick of timber,
falling upon him, that same day.</p>

<p>It is quite true that we do not attach nearly
as much importance to events happening a
long time ago as to those occurring in our
own day; for one thing, perhaps, because
they do not seem so easy of verification; for
another, because we choose to believe that
they merely reflect the ignorance of a past
age. That there is really no difference in the
susceptibility of man to such premonitions, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
long as he shall be the creature of feeling,
is proved by the most irrefragable testimony.
The poet Whittier, who took a peculiar delight
in the legendary tales of New England, has
related one or two incidents that came within
his own knowledge, to this effect. &#8220;A very
honest and intelligent neighbor of mine,&#8221; says
the narrator, &#8220;once told me that at the precise
moment when his brother was drowned
in the Merrimack River, many miles distant, he
felt a sudden and painful sensation&mdash;a death-like
chill upon the heart, such as he had
never before experienced. And,&#8221; adds the
poet, &#8220;I have heard many similar relations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following, he says, &#8220;are the facts,&#8221;
relative to another incident that happened in
his vicinity. &#8220;In September, 1831, a worthy
and highly esteemed inhabitant of this town
(Haverhill, Mass.) died suddenly on the bridge
over the Merrimack, by the bursting of a blood-vessel.
It was just at daybreak, when he was
engaged with another person in raising the
draw of the bridge for the passage of a sloop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
The suddenness of the event, the excellent
character of the deceased, and above all, a
vague rumor that some extraordinary disclosure
was to be made, drew together a
large concourse at the funeral. After the
solemn services were concluded, Thomas, the
brother of the dead man&mdash;himself a most
exemplary Christian&mdash;rose up and desired to
relate some particulars regarding his brother&#8217;s
death. He then stated&mdash;and his manner was
calm, solemn, impressive&mdash;that more than a
month previous to his death, his brother had
told him that his feelings had been painfully
disturbed by seeing, at different times on the
bridge, a quantity of human blood; that sometimes
while he was gazing upon it, it suddenly
disappeared, as if removed by an invisible
hand; ... that many times in the dusk of
the evening, he had seen a vessel coming
down the river, which vanished just as it
reached the draw; and that, at the same time,
he had heard a voice calling in a faint and
lamentable tone, &#8216;I am dying!&#8217; and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
voice sounded like his own: that then he
knew the vision was for him, and that his
hour of departure was at hand. Thomas,
moreover, stated that a few days before the
melancholy event took place, his brother, after
assuring him that he would be called upon to
testify to the accounts which he had given of
the vision on the bridge, told him that he had
actually seen the same vessel go up the river
whose spectral image he had seen in his
vision, and that when it returned the fatal
fulfilment would take place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though of still earlier date, the remarkable
premonition of Rev. Samuel Newman, of
Rehoboth, will bear being repeated here.
According to his biographer, he not only felt
a certain presage of the approach of death, but
seemed to triumph in the prospect of its being
near. Yet he was apparently in perfect health,
and preached a sermon from Job xiv. 14, &#8220;All
the days of my appointed time will I wait till
my change come.&#8221; In the afternoon of the
following Lord&#8217;s Day, he asked the deacon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
pray with him, saying he had not long to live.
As soon as he had finished his prayer he said
the time was come when he must leave the
world; but his friends seeing no sign of
approaching dissolution, thought it was merely
the effect of imagination. Immediately he
turned away, saying, &#8220;Angels, do your office!&#8221;
and expired on the spot.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts of Kandahar relates the following
of himself: &#8220;My intention, when I left
Kabul, was to ride as far as the Khyber Pass;
but suddenly a presentiment, which I have
never been able to explain to myself, made me
retrace my steps and hurry back toward Kabul&mdash;a
presentiment of coming trouble which I can
only characterize as instinctive.</p>

<p>&#8220;The feeling was justified when, about halfway
between Butkhak and Kabul, I was met
by Sir Donald Stewart and my chief of the
staff, who brought me the astounding news of
the total defeat by Ayab Khan of Brigadier-general
Burrows&#8217;s brigade at Malwand, and
of Lieutenant-general Primrose, with the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
of his force, being besieged at Kandahar.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Most people are familiar with the story told
by President Lincoln to a friend,&mdash;told too, in
his own half-playful, half-pathetic way, as if to
minimize the effect upon that friend&#8217;s mind.
It is given in the words of that <span class="locked">friend:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;It was just after my election in 1860, when
the news had been coming in thick and fast all
day and there had been a great &#8216;hurrah, boys,&#8217;
so that I was well tired out and went home to
rest, throwing myself down on a lounge in my
chamber. Opposite where I lay was a bureau
with a swinging glass upon it (and here he got
up and placed furniture to illustrate the position),
and looking in that glass I saw myself
reflected nearly at full length; but my face, I
noticed, had <i>two</i> separate and distinct images,
the tip of the nose of one being about three
inches from the tip of the other. I was a little
bothered, perhaps startled, and got up and
looked in the glass, but the illusion vanished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
On lying down again, I saw it a second time,
plainer if possible, than before; and then I
noticed that one of the faces was a little paler&mdash;say,
five shades&mdash;than the other, I got up,
and the thing melted away; and I went off, and
in the excitement of the hour forgot all about it&mdash;nearly,
but not quite, for the thing would
once in a while come up and give me a little
pang, as if something uncomfortable had happened.
When I went home again that night, I
told my wife about it, and a few days afterward
I made the experiment again, when (with a
laugh), sure enough! the thing came again; but
I never succeeded in bringing the ghost back
after that, though I once tried very industriously
to show it to my wife, who was somewhat worried
about it. She thought it was a &#8216;sign&#8217; that
I was to be elected to a second term of office,
and that the paleness of one of the faces was an
omen that I should not see life through the last
term.&#8221;</p>

<p>These are by no means isolated cases. It is
said that General Hancock, who had faced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
King of Terrors on too many battle-fields to fear
him, was pursued by a presentiment of this sort,
only too soon to be fully verified. While present
as an honored guest at a dinner, surrounded by
his old comrades in arms, the general remarked
to a friend that he had come there with a premonition
that it would be his last visit, and that he
had but a short time longer to live. In fact, his
lamented death occurred within a short time after.</p>

<p>Instances of fatal presentiments before going
into battle are familiar to every veteran of our
great Civil War. I have heard many of them
feelingly rehearsed by eye-witnesses. The same
thing has occurred, under precisely similar conditions,
during the late war with Spain. But
here is a tale of that earlier conflict, as published
broadcast to the world, without question
or <span class="locked">qualification:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;In a research for facts bearing upon psychology,
Mrs. Bancroft (a daughter-in-law of
the historian) has brought to light a strange
story relating to either the record of odd &#8216;spirit
communications&#8217; or coincidences. On July 2,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
1863, the wives of Major Thomas Y. Brent and
Captain Eugene Barnes, two Confederate officers,
were together at a wedding in Fayette
County, each wearing her bridal dress. While
dressing for the occasion Mrs. Brent&#8217;s companion
discovered a blood spot upon the dress of
the major&#8217;s wife, which could not be accounted
for, and somewhat excitedly exclaimed, &#8216;It is a
bad omen!&#8217; Two days after Mrs. Brent experienced
a severe pain in the region of her heart,
although at the time in the best of health. This
occurred at the birthplace of her husband. Two
days later she heard that, while storming a
Federal fortification, her husband was killed on
July 4, 1863, as far as she could learn, at the
identical time that she had experienced the
heart pain. The major was shot in the breast
by a Minié ball and instantly killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>There lies before me, as I write, the authoritative
statement of an army officer, a survivor
of the terrible charge up San Juan Hill, before
Santiago de Cuba, to the effect that just before
advancing to the charge a brother officer had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
confided to him a conviction that the speaker
would be killed, entreating his friend to receive
his last messages for his relatives. In this
case, too, the fatal premonition was fully verified.
The doomed man was shot while bravely
storming the Spanish stronghold.</p>

<p>Still another story of this war has been widely
published, so lately as this chapter was begun.
It has reference to the death of the bandmaster
of the United States ship <i class="ship">Lancaster</i>, then cruising
in the South Atlantic. Upon learning that
the <i class="ship">Lancaster</i> was to touch at Rio de Janeiro
the bandmaster requested his discharge, giving
as his reason that he had for years been under
the presentiment that if he went to that port he
would die of yellow fever. A discharge was
refused him. The ship entered the harbor of
Rio, and the bandmaster immediately took to
his bed with all the symptoms of yellow fever.
The identity of the malady soon established
itself. He was taken to the plague hospital on
shore and there died. One of the bandsmen
who kissed him as he was being removed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
the ship also died. The account goes on to say
that &#8220;these two are the only cases reported at
Rio for months. The fever has not spread,
and no man besides the unfortunate bandsman
caught the fever, the health of the ship&#8217;s crew
remaining excellent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The number of persons who have testified
to having seen the apparitions or death wraiths
of dying or deceased friends is already large,
as the records of various societies for psychical
research bear witness. These phenomena are
not in their nature forewarnings of something
that is about to happen, but announcements of
something that already has happened. They
therefore can have no relation to what was
formerly known as &#8220;second sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of all that our much-boasted civilization
has done in the way of freeing poor, fallible
man from the thraldom of superstition,
there is indubitable evidence that a great many
people still put faith in direct revelations from
the land of spirits. In the course of a quiet
chat one evening, where the subject was under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
discussion, one of the company who had listened
attentively, though silently all the while,
to all manner of theories, spiced with ridicule,
abruptly asked how we would account for the
following incident which he went on to relate,
and I have here set down word for <span class="locked">word:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;My grandparents,&#8221; he began, &#8220;had a son
whom they thought all the world of. From all
accounts I guess Tom was about one of the likeliest
young fellows that could be scared up in a
day&#8217;s journey. Everybody said Tom was bound
to make his mark in the world, and at the time
I speak of he seemed in a fair way of doing it,
too, for at one and twenty he was first mate of
the old <i class="ship">Argonaut</i> which had just sailed for Calcutta.
This would make her tenth voyage.
Well, as I am telling you, the very day after
the <i class="ship">Argonaut</i> went to sea, a tremendous gale
set in from the eastward. It blew great guns.
Actually, now, it seemed as if that gale would
never stop blowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;As day after day went by, and the storm
raged on without intermission, you may judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
if the hearts of those who had friends at sea
in that ship did not sink down and down with
the passing hours. Of course, the old folks
could think of nothing else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see; it was a good bit ago. Ah,
yes; it was on the third or fourth night of
the gale, I don&#8217;t rightly remember which, and
it don&#8217;t matter much, that grandfather and
grandmother were sitting together, as usual,
in the old family sitting-room, he poring over
the family Bible as he was wont to do in such
cases, she knitting and rocking, or pretending
to knit, but both full of the one ever present
thought, which each was trying so hard to
hide from the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dismally splashed the raindrops against
the window-panes, mournfully the wind whined
in the chimney-top, while every now and then
the fire would spit and sputter angrily on the
hearth, or flare up fitfully when some big
gust came roaring down the chimney to fan
the embers into a fiercer flame. Then there
would be a lull, during which, like an echo of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the tempest, the dull and distant booming of
the sea was borne to the affrighted listener&#8217;s
ears. But nothing I could say would begin
to give you an idea of the great gale of 1817.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the old folks sat there as stiff as two
statues, listening to every sound. When a big
gust tore over the house and shook it till it
rocked again, gran&#8217;ther would steal a look
at grandmother over his specs, but say never a
word. The old lady would give a start, let her
hands fall idly upon her lap, sit for a moment
as if dazed, and then go on with her knitting
again as if her very life depended on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unable at length to control her feelings,
grandmother got up out of her chair, with her
work in her hand, went to the window, put
aside the curtain, and looked out. I say
looked out, for of course all was so pitch-dark
outside that nothing could be seen, yet
there she stood with her white face pressed
close to the wet panes, peering out into the
night, as if questioning the storm itself of the
absent one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
&#8220;All at once she drew back from the window
with a low cry, saying in a broken voice:
&#8216;My God, father, it&#8217;s Tom in his coffin!
They&#8217;re bringing him up here, to the house.&#8217;
Then she covered her face with her hands,
to shut out the horrid sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Set down &#8217;Mandy!&#8217; sternly commanded
the startled old man. &#8216;Don&#8217;t be making a
fool of yourself. Don&#8217;t ye know tain&#8217;t no
sech a thing what you&#8217;re sayin&#8217;? Set down,
I say, this minnit!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But no one could ever convince grandmother
that she had not actually seen, with
her own eyes, her dear boy Tom, the idol of
her heart, lying cold in death. To her indeed
it was a revelation from the tomb, for the
ship in which Tom had sailed was never
heard from.&#8221;</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DIVINING-ROD</span></h2>

<div class="center-container b1"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;One point must still be greatly dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reason why they do it.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">It</span> is a matter of common knowledge that
certain expert &#8220;finders,&#8221; as they are called,
use a divining-rod for detecting underground
springs in New England; in Pennsylvania for
the locating of oil springs; and in the mineral
regions of the Rockies for the discovery of
hidden veins of valuable ores. The Cornish
miners, also, have long made use of the divining-rod,
or &#8220;dowsing-rod,&#8221; as they call it, for
a like purpose. A further research, probably,
might reveal a similar practice in other countries;
but for our purpose it is enough to present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
two of the most intelligent in the world as
giving it their sanction and support.</p>

<p>Various implements are employed by the
expert operator in his quest for what lies hidden
from mortal eyes; but the preferred agent
is usually a bough of witch-hazel, branching at
one end like the tines of a <span class="locked">pitchfork.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> Taking
firm hold of each prong, with the palms of the
hands turned upward, the operator slowly walks
around the locality where it is desired to find
water; and when he reaches the right spot,
<i>presto!</i> the free end of the bough is bent downward
toward the ground as if by some invisible
force, sometimes so strongly that the operator
is unable to overcome it by putting forth his
whole strength. &#8220;Dig here,&#8221; he says, with
positive assurance that water will be found
not far below the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>On the face of it, this performance comes
rather nearer to our idea of a miracle than anything
we can now call to mind. Certainly,
Moses did no more when he smote the rock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Scripture. Very possibly, former generations
of men may have associated the act with the
operation of sorcery or magic. An enlightened
age, however, accepts neither of these theories.
We do not believe in miracles other than those
recorded in Scripture; and we have renounced
magic and sorcery as too antiquated for intelligent
people to consider. Yet things are done
every day which would have passed for miracles
with our forefathers, without our knowing more
than the bare fact that, by means of certain
crude agents, obtained from the earth itself,
messages are sent from New York to London
under the Atlantic Ocean in a few minutes;
that the most remote parts of the habitable
globe have been brought into practically instantaneous
communication, the one with the other;
and that public and private conveyances are
moving about our thoroughfares without the
use of horses or steam. All these things
looked to us like miracles, at first, yet custom
has brought us to regard them with no more
wonder than did the lighting of the first gas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
lamp the pedestrian of forty odd years ago.
Much as we know, there is probably yet much
more that we do not know.</p>

<p>The methods employed in finding oil springs
or &#8220;leads&#8221; of ore are very similar to those
made use of in discovering water. It is a fact
that some of the most productive wells in the
oil regions were located in this manner. It is
a further fact, that from time to time, search
for buried treasure has been carried on in precisely
the same way. Now some astute critics
have said that the divining-rod was a humbug,
because when they have tried it the mystic
bough would not bend for them. It is, however,
doubtful if any humbug could have stood
the test of so many years without exposure, or
what so many witnesses stand ready to affirm
the truth of be cavalierly thrust aside as a palpable
imposture.</p>

<p>Although I have never seen the operator at
work, myself, I have often talked with those
who have, whose testimony was both direct
and explicit. Moreover, I do know of persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
who continue to ply this trade (for no more
than this is claimed for it) in some parts of
New England to-day. Whether it should be
classed among superstitions may be an open
question after all.</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">All</span> abnormal exhibitions of nature, or in
fact any departure from the regular
order of things, such as great and unusual
storms, earthquakes, eclipses of the sun or
moon, the appearance of a comet in the
heavens, or of a plague of flies, caterpillars,
or locusts were once held to be so many infallible
signs of impending calamity. All of our
early historians give full and entire credit to
the evil import of these startling phenomena,
which were invariably referred to the wrath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
of an offended deity, only to be appeased by
a special season of fasting and prayer. Of
course ample warrant exists for such belief in
the Bible, which was something no man dared
question or gainsay in those primitive days.
For example, in his history of Philip&#8217;s War,
Increase Mather lays down this, to our age,
startling proposition. &#8220;It is,&#8221; says the learned
divine, &#8220;a common observation, verified by the
experience of many ages, that <i>great and publick
calamityes seldome come upon any place
without prodigious warnings to forerun and
signify what is to be expected</i>.&#8221; He had just
noted the appearance &#8220;in the aire,&#8221; at Plymouth,
of something shaped in the perfect
form of an Indian bow, which some of the
terror-stricken people looked upon as a
&#8220;prodigious apparition.&#8221; The learned divine
cleverly interpreted it as a favorable omen,
however, portending that the Lord would
presently &#8220;break the bow and spear asunder,&#8221;
thus calming their fears.</p>

<p>This extract taken at random, fairly establishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
the survival of certain forms of superstition
in the second generation of colonists.
The first, as has been said already, brought
all of its old superstitions with it. In short,
every form of belief in the supernatural, for
which the fathers of New England have been
so roundly abused or ridiculed, may be distinctly
traced back to the old country.</p>

<p>Very much of the belief in the baleful
influence of so-called prodigies, with the possible
exception of that ascribed to comets,
or &#8220;blazing stars,&#8221; as they were called, has
fortunately subsided in a measure, for we
shudder to think of a state of things so
thoroughly calculated to keep society continually
on the rack. But in those earlier times
life and death had about equal terrors. Sin
and sinners were punished both here and
hereafter; and, really, if we may credit such
writers as the Rev. William Hubbard and
the Mather family, poor New England was
quite ripe, in their time, for the fate of Sodom
and Gomorrah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
As regards comets, we risk little in saying
that a great many very sensible people still
view their periodical appearance with fear
and trembling, and their departure with a
feeling of unfeigned relief. It is our unwilling
tribute to the unfathomable and the unknown.
And, disguise it as we may, we
breathe more freely when the dread visitant
has faded from our sight. In the language
of Macbeth after seeing Banquo&#8217;s <span class="locked">ghost,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Why, so: being gone, I am a man again.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In truth, we know comets as yet only as the
accredited agents of destruction. It seems a
natural question to ask, If order is nature&#8217;s
first law, why are all these departures from
it? Can they be without fixed end, aim, or
purpose? Why should the solid earth quake,
the sea overwhelm the land, mountains vomit
forth flames, the tempest scatter death and
destruction abroad, the heavens suspend a
winged and flaming monster over <span class="locked">us,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;So horribly to shake our disposition,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls&#8221;?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was still another form of belief, differing
from the first in ascribing supernatural
functions to great natural phenomena. In this
sense, the storm did not descend in the majesty
of its mighty wrath to punish man&#8217;s wickedness,
but, like the roar of artillery which
announces the death of the monarch to his
mourning people, was coincident, in its coming,
with the death of some great personage,
which it proclaimed with salvos of Olympus.
Indeed, poets and philosophers of keen insight
have frequently recognized this sort of
curious sympathy in nature with most momentous
movements in human life. We are told
that the dying hours of Cromwell and Napoleon
were signalized by storms of terrific violence,
and Shakespeare describes the earth
and air as filled with omens before the murders
of Julius Cæsar and of King Duncan.</p>

<p>&#8220;As busy as the devil in a gale of wind,&#8221;
emphasizes by a robust, sea-seasoned saying
the notion current among sailors of how storms
arise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
It was just now said that the belief in
direct manifestations of the divine wrath,
through the medium of such calamitous visitations
as great droughts, earthquakes, eclipses,
tidal waves, fatal epidemics, and the like, had,
in a measure, subsided. The statement should
be made, however, with certain qualification;
for it is well remembered that during a season
of unexampled drought, in the far West, the
people were called together in their churches,
and on a week-day, too, to pray for rain, just
as we are told that the Pilgrim Fathers did,
on a like occasion, two hundred and fifty odd
years before. Prayers were kept up without
intermission during the day. And it is a further
coincidence that copious showers did set in
within twenty-four hours or so. Even the
most sceptical took refuge in silence.</p>

<p>From many different sources we have very
detailed accounts of the remarkable dark day
of May 19, 1780, with the great fear that phenomenon
inspired in those who witnessed it,
the general belief being that the Day of Judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
was at <span class="locked">hand.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> In the presence of this
overshadowing terror, few retained their usual
presence of mind unshaken. One such instance
is worth repeating here, if only for its rarity.
At that time the Connecticut legislature was
in session. The House of Representatives
immediately adjourned. A like motion was
before the Council. The protest of Colonel
Davenport has become historical. Said he,
&#8220;The Day of Judgment is either approaching
or it is not. If it is, I choose to be found
doing my duty. I wish, therefore, that candles
may be lighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearly fifty years later (September, 1825),
a similar visitation, due to extensive forest
fires in New Brunswick, again created widespread
alarm, hardly quieted by the later knowledge
of the atmospheric conditions (an under
stratum of fog and an upper stratum of smoke)
that were so plainly responsible for it. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
the contrary, from what we have been able
to gather on the subject, it appears that where
the phenomenon was visible, people were quite
as ill at ease as their fathers were.</p>

<p>Once again, under almost identical conditions,
the same phenomenon wrought exactly
the same chaos in the minds of a very large
number of people in New England and New
York. This has passed into history as the
Yellow Tuesday (September 6, 1881). On
this occasion the brooding darkness lasted all
day. It was noticed that a fire built in the
open air burned with a spectral blue flame.
Blue flowers were changed to a crimson hue.
By two in the afternoon one could not see to
read without a light. At a certain hotel in
the White Mountains some of the servants
were so frightened that they refused to go to
work, and fell to praying instead.</p>

<p>These examples at least afford data for a
comparison of some little interest, as to how
any wide departure from nature&#8217;s fixed laws
has affected the human mind at widely separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
periods of time, all the theories or
demonstrations of science to the contrary
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>So much for the effects of what is a reality
to be seen and felt by all men. But now and
again the mere haphazard predictions of some
self-constituted prophet of evil, if plausibly presented
and steadily insisted upon, find a multitude
of credulous believers among us. It is
only a few years since a certain religious sect,
notwithstanding repeated failures in the past,
with much consequent ridicule, again ventured
to fix a day for the second coming of Our
Lord. Similarly it falls within the recollection
of most of us how a certain self-constituted
Canadian seer solemnly predicted the coming
of a monster tidal wave, which in its
disastrous effects was to be another Deluge.
All the great Atlantic seaboard was to be
buried in the rush of mighty waters; all its
great maritime cities swept away in a moment.
Fresher still in the recollection is the prediction
that the end of the world would surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
come as the inevitable result of the shower
of meteors of November, 1899.</p>

<p>It is a fact that many good and worthy but,
alas! too credulous people living along the New
England coast, who believed themselves in danger
from the destroying tidal wave, were thrown
into a state of unspeakable agitation and alarm
by this wicked prediction. Yet there was absolutely
nothing to warrant it except the unsupported
declaration of this one man, whom no
one knew, and few had ever heard of. Yet
some really believed, more half believed, and
some who openly ridiculed the prediction
apparently did so more to keep their courage
up than from actual unbelief. So easy it is to
arouse the fears of a community, who usually
act first and reason afterward. I heard of one
man who actually packed all his household
goods in a wagon, so as to be ready to start off
for higher ground upon the first signal of the
approach of this much-dreaded rush of waters.</p>

<span class="subhead">&#8220;SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Songe est toujours mensonge</i>,&#8221; says a French
proverb; &#8220;Dreams go by contraries&#8221; says the
English proverb,&mdash;that is, if you dream of
the dead you will hear from the living. Who
shall decide, where the collective wisdom of
centuries is at such wide variance?</p>

<p>To put faith in the supposed revelations of a
disordered or overheated brain seems, on the
face of it, sheer absurdity, especially when we
ourselves may induce dreaming merely by overindulgence
in eating or drinking. Yet there
are people who habitually dream when the
brain is in its normal condition. This brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the question down to its simplest form, &#8220;What
is a dream?&#8221; And there we halt.</p>

<p>That there is no end of theories concerning
the measure of credit that should be given to
dreams is readily accounted for. What nobody
can explain every one is at liberty to have his
own peculiar notions of. Perhaps the most
curious thing about it is the proven fact that so
many different people should dream precisely
the same thing from time to time; so making
it possible not only to classify and analyze
dreams, but even to lay down certain interpretations,
to be accepted by a multitude of believers.
Of course it is easy to laugh at the incoherent
fancies that flit through the debatable region
we inhabit while asleep, but it is not so easy to
explain why we laugh, or why we should dream
of persons or events long since passed from our
memories, or of other persons or events wholly
unknown to us, either in the past or the present.</p>

<p>Without a doubt people dream just as much
nowadays as they ever did. That fact being
admitted, the problem for us to consider is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
whether the belief in the prophetic character
of dreams, held by so many peoples for so many
centuries, having the unequivocal sanction, too,
of Scripture authority, is really dying out, or
continues to hold its old dominion over the
minds of poor, fallible mankind. In order to
determine this vexed question inquiry was made
of several leading booksellers with the following
result: Thirty or forty years ago dream books
were as much a recognized feature of the book-selling
trade as any other sort of literary property;
consequently, they were openly exposed
for sale in every bookstore, large or small. It
now appears that these yellow-covered oracles
of fate are still in good demand, mostly by servant
girls and factory girls, and, though seldom
found in the best bookstores, may be readily
had of most dealers in cheap periodicals. This,
certainly, would seem to be a gain in the direction
of education, though not of the masses. It
also appears that, as in the matter of &#8220;signs,&#8221;
the female sex is more susceptible to this sort
of superstition than is the male; but that by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
means proves the sterner sex to be wholly free
from it.</p>

<p>Some persons dream a great deal, others but
seldom. Let one who is not much addicted to
the habit have a bad dream, a frightful dream,
and be he never so well poised, the phantasm
can hardly fail of leaving a disquieting, perhaps
a lasting, effect. Seldom, indeed, can that person
shake off the feeling that the dream forbodes
something of a sinister nature. In vain
he racks his brain for some interpretation that
may set his mind at rest, wholly forgetful of
the trite adage that dreams go by contraries.</p>

<p>So often, indeed, do we hear the pregnant
declaration, to wit: &#8220;Your old men shall dream
dreams, your young men see visions,&#8221; that we
have adopted it as a striking rhetorical figure
of wide application. In Hamlet&#8217;s celebrated
soliloquy upon the immortality of the soul, the
melancholy Dane confesses to an overmastering
fear of bad dreams. And once again, as if
wrung from the very anguish of his sinful
heart, Gloster cries out: &#8220;Oh, Catesby, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
had such horrid dreams!&#8221; And Catesby expostulates,
&#8220;Shadows, my lord, below the
soldiers seeming.&#8221; But Gloster thrusts aside
the rebuke as he impetuously exclaims: &#8220;Now
by my this day&#8217;s hopes, shadows to-night have
struck more terror to the soul of Richard, than
can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
arm&#8217;d all in proof.&#8221;</p>

<p>We find that our own immediate ancestors
were fully as credulous in regard to the importance
of dreams, as affecting their lives and
fortunes, as the ancients appear to have been.
But with them it is true that Scripture warrant
was accepted as all-sufficient. Just a few
examples will suffice.</p>

<p>In the time of its disintegration, owing to the
removal of some of its members to Connecticut,
the church of Dorchester, Massachusetts,
&#8220;did not reorganize on account of certain
dreams and visions among the congregation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under a certain date, Samuel Sewall sets
down the fact that he has had disturbing
dreams, which he, according to his wont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
anxiously strives to interpret&mdash;he, of all men!&mdash;a
magistrate, a councillor, and a ruler in the
land. One dream was to the effect &#8220;that all
my [his] children were dead except Sarah,
which did distress me sorely with reflections on
my omissions of duty towards them as well as
breaking of the hopes I had of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shifting now the scene to half a century
later, we find in the &#8220;Diary and Letters of
Sarah Pierpont,&#8221; wife of the celebrated theologian,
Jonathan Edwards, this letter, describing
a singularly prophetic dream relative to her
grandson, then an infant, Aaron <span class="locked">Burr:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote class="blocknobreak">

<p class="sigright">
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Stockbridge</span>, May 10, 1756.<br /></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Brother James</span>: Your letters always
do us good, and your last was one of your best.
Have you heard of the birth of Esther&#8217;s second
child, at Newark? It was born the sixth of
February last, and its parents have named him
Aaron Burr, Jr., after his father, the worthy
President of the College. I trust the little immortal
will grow up to be a good and useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
man. But, somehow, a strange presentiment of
evil has hung over my mind of late, and I can
hardly rid myself of the impression that that
child was born to see trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I don&#8217;t believe in dreams and
visions; but lately I had a sad night of broken
sleep, in which the future career of that boy
seemed to pass before me. He first appeared
as a little child, just beginning to ascend a high
hill. Not long after he set out, the two guides
who started with him disappeared one after the
other. He went on alone, and as the road was
open and plain, and as friends met him at every
turn, he got along very well. At times he took
on the air and bearing of a soldier, and then
of a statesman, assuming to lead and control
others. As he neared the top of the hill, the
way grew more steep and difficult, and his
companions became alienated from him, refusing
to help him or be led by him. Baffled in
his designs, and angered at his ill-success, he
began to lay about him with violence, leading
some astray, and pulling down others at every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
attempt to rise. Soon he himself began to slip
and slide down the rough and perilous sides of
the hill; now regaining his foothold for a little,
then losing it again, until at length he stumbled
and fell headlong down, down, into a black and
yawning gulf at the base!</p>

<p>&#8220;At this, I woke in distress, and was glad
enough to find it was only a dream. Now, you
may make as much or as little of this as you
please. I think the disturbed state of our
country, along with my own indifferent health,
must have occasioned it. A letter from his

<p>Though &#8220;only a dream,&#8221; this vision of the
night prefigured a sad reality, for within two
years both of the &#8220;guides&#8221; had gone, President
Burr in September, 1757, his wife in the same
month of the next year, 1758.</p>

<p>Passing now down to our own day, the Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Walter Colton, sometime alcalde of Monterey,
tells us, in his reminiscences of the gold excitement
of 1849, that he dreamed of finding gold
at a certain spot, had faith enough in his
dream to seek for it in that place, and was
rewarded by finding it there.</p>

<p>A mass of similar testimony might be
adduced. One piece coming from a brave
soldier, who will not be accused of harboring
womanish fears, will bear repeating here. We
again quote from that most interesting volume,
&#8220;Forty-one Years in India.&#8221; Lord Roberts, its
author, is speaking of his father, then a man
close upon seventy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shortly before his departure an incident
occurred which I will relate for the benefit of
psychological students; they may perhaps be
able to explain it, I never could. My father
had some time before issued invitations for a
dance which was to take place in two days&#8217; time,&mdash;on
Monday, the 17th October, 1853. On the
Saturday morning he appeared disturbed and
unhappy, and during breakfast was despondent&mdash;very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
different from his usual bright and
cheery self. On my questioning him as to
the cause, he told me he had had an unpleasant
dream&mdash;one which he had dreamt several
times before, and which had always been
followed by the death of a near relation. As
the day advanced, in spite of my efforts to
cheer him, he became more and more depressed,
and even said he should like to put off the
dance. I dissuaded him from taking this step
for the time being; but that night he had the
same dream again, and the next morning he
insisted on the dance being postponed. It
seemed rather absurd to disappoint our friends
on account of a dream; there was, however,
nothing for it but to carry out my father&#8217;s wishes,
and intimation was accordingly sent to the
invited guests. The following morning the post
brought news of the sudden death of a half-sister
at Lahore, with whom I had stayed on my way
to Pashawar.&#8221;</p>

<p>A man is now living who ran away from the
vessel in which he had shipped as a sailor before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
the mast, in consequence of dreaming for
three nights in succession that the vessel would
be lost. All the circumstances were related
to me, with much minuteness of detail, by persons
quite familiar with them at the time of
their occurrence. The vessel was, in fact, cast
away, and every one on board drowned, on the
very night after she sailed; consequently the
warning dream, by means of which the deserter&#8217;s
life was saved, could hardly fail of
leaving a deep and lasting impression upon the
minds of all who knew the facts. The story
has been told more at length elsewhere by the
<span class="locked">writer,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> as it came from the lips of a seafaring
friend; and the hero of it is still pointed out to
sceptics as a living example of the fact <span class="locked">that&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Coming events cast their shadows before.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Richard Mansfield, distinguished actor and
playwright, has recently related in an interview
a most interesting incident in his own
career, which he declared himself wholly unable
to account for. So much more credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
attaches to the testimony of persons if known
to the public even by name, that Mr. Mansfield&#8217;s
experience has special value here. It is
also a highly interesting fragment of autobiography.</p>

<p>Mr. Mansfield goes on to say that after leading
a most precarious existence, in various ways,
his discharge from Mr. D&#8217;Oyley Carte&#8217;s company
brought on a crisis in his affairs. Reaching
his poor lodgings in London, he soon fell
into desperate straits, being soon forced to
pawn what little he had for the means to keep
body and soul together. He declares that he
did not know which way to turn, and that the
most gloomy forebodings overwhelmed him.
We will now let him tell his own story in his
own <span class="locked">way:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;This was the condition of affairs when the
strange happening to which I have referred
befell me. Retiring for the night in a perfectly
hopeless frame of mind, I fell into a
troubled sleep and dreamed dreams. Finally,
toward morning, this apparent fantasy came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
me. I seemed in my disturbed sleep to hear a
cab drive up to the door as if in a great hurry.
There was a knock, and in my dream I opened
the door and found D&#8217;Oyley Carte&#8217;s yellow-haired
secretary standing outside. He <span class="locked">exclaimed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Can you pack up and catch the train in
ten minutes to rejoin the company?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can,&#8217; was the dreamland reply; there
seemed to be a rushing about while I swept
a few things into my bag; then the cab door
was slammed, and we were off to the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;This was all a dream,&#8221; continued Mr.
Mansfield; &#8220;but here is the inexplicable denouement.
The dream was so vivid and startling
that I immediately awoke with a strange,
uncanny sensation, and sprang to my feet. It
was six o&#8217;clock, and only bare and gloomy surroundings
met my eye. On a chair rested my
travelling bag, and through some impulse which
I could not explain at the time and cannot
account for now I picked it up and hurriedly
swept into it the few articles that had escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the pawnshop. It did not take me long to complete
my toilet, and then I sat down to think.</p>

<p>&#8220;Presently, when I had reached the extreme
point of dejection, a cab rattled up, there was
a knock, and I opened the door. There stood
D&#8217;Oyley Carte&#8217;s secretary, just as I saw him in
my dreams. He seemed to be in a great flurry,
and cried <span class="locked">out:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Can you pack up and reach the station in
ten minutes to rejoin the company?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can,&#8217; said I, calmly, pointing to my bag.
&#8216;It is all ready, for I was expecting you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man was a little startled by this seemingly
strange remark, but bundled me into the
cab without further ado, and we hurried away
to the station exactly in accord with my dream.
That was the beginning of a long engagement,
and, although I have known hard times since,
it was the turning-point in my career. I have
already said that I have no theories whatever
in regard to the matter. I do not account for
it. It is enough for me to know that I dreamed
certain things which were presently realized in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
the exact order of the dream. Having no
superstitions, it is impossible to philosophize
over the occurrence. All I know is that everything
happened just as I have stated it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some of the hidden meanings attributed to
dreams are elsewhere referred to. As the
subject has a literature of its own, we need
mention only a few of the more commonly accepted
interpretations. Their name is legion.</p>

<p>To dream of a white horse is a certain presage
of a death in the family.</p>

<p>To dream of a funeral is a sign that you
will soon attend a wedding.</p>

<p>To dream of losing one&#8217;s teeth is ominous
of some coming sorrow.</p>

<p>To dream of a snake is a token that you
have an enemy.</p>

<p>Touching a dead body will prevent dreaming
of it.</p>

<p>The same dream, occurring three nights in
succession, will surely come to pass.</p>

<p>A slice of wedding-cake put under the pillow
will cause an unmarried woman to dream of her
future husband.</p>

<span class="subhead">FORTUNE-TELLING, ASTROLOGY,
AND PALMISTRY</span></h2>

<div class="center-container b1"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;I asked her of the way, which she informed me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then craved my charity, and bade me hasten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save a sister.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Otway.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">One</span> noticeable thing about certain forms
of superstition is their general acceptance
by the public at large, like certain moral
evils, which it is felt to be an almost hopeless
task to do away with. Other good, easy souls
choose to ignore the presence of fortune-tellers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
astrologers, palmists among their daily haunts.
As a matter of fact, however, fortune-telling,
astrology, and palmistry have become so fully
incorporated with the everyday life of all large
communities as to excite very little comment
from the common run of us.</p>

<p>It certainly would astonish some people if
they knew to what an extent these methods of
hoodwinking the credulous, or weak-minded,
continue to flourish in our large cities, without
the least attempt at concealment or disguise.
One need only look about him to see the signs
of these shrewd charlatans everywhere staring
him in the face, or run his eye over the columns
of the daily papers to be convinced how far
superstition still lives and thrives in the chosen
strongholds of modern thought and modern
scepticism. At fairs and social gatherings fortune-telling
and palmistry have come to be
recognized features, either as a means of raising
funds for some highly deserving object, of
course, or for the sake of the amusement they
afford, at the expense of those well-meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
souls who do not know how to say no. To be
sure, it has come to be thoroughly understood
that no benevolent object whatsoever has a
chance of succeeding nowadays without some
sort of nickel-in-the-slot attachment, by which
the delusion of getting something for your
money is so clumsily kept up.</p>

<p>At fairs, for instance, it is not necessary that
the oracle of fortune should speak. Time is
saved and modern progress illustrated and
enforced by having printed cards ready at hand
to be impartially distributed to all applicants on
the principle of first come, first served. As the
victim receives his card, he laughs nervously,
fidgets around a few minutes, goes aside into
some quiet corner and furtively reads, &#8220;Fortune
will be more favorable to you in future
than it has been.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unwittingly, perhaps, yet none the less, has
he paid his tribute to superstition, thus thriftily
turned to account.</p>

<p>The penny-in-the-slot machines, so often seen
in public places, tell fortunes with mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
precision, and in the main, impartially, evident
care being taken not to render the oracle unpopular
by giving out disagreeable or alarming
predictions. True, they are just a trifle ambiguous,
but does not that feature exactly correspond
with the traditional idea of the ancient
oracle, which was nothing if not ambiguous?
Here is a sample, &#8220;You will not become very
rich, but be assured you will never want for
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortune-telling also is openly carried on at
all popular summer resorts, with considerable
profit to the dealer in prophecies, who is generally
an Indian woman. She is much consulted
by young women, &#8220;just for the fun of
the thing.&#8221; Roving bands of gypsies continue
to do a more or less thriving business in the
country towns. Character is unfolded or the
future foretold by the color of the eyes,
the length or breadth of the finger nails or of
the eyebrows.</p>

<p>Telling fortunes by means of tea grounds is
often practised at social gatherings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<div class="center-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="iq">&#8220;For still, by some invisible tether<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scandal and tea are linked together.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">It is done in this way: When drinking off
the tea, the grounds are made to adhere to
the sides of the tea-cup, by swiftly twirling it
round and round. The cup is then inverted,
turned thrice and no more, after which the
spell is completed, and the mistress of the
revels proceeds to tell the fortunes of those
present, with neatness and despatch.</p>

<p>Time has worked certain marked changes
in the method of practising this equivocal
trade. The modern fortune-teller no longer
inhabits a grewsome cavern, reached by a
winding path among overhanging rocks, and
choked with dank weeds, or goes about muttering
to herself in an unknown tongue, or is
clothed in rags. Far from it. She either
occupies luxurious apartments in the best business
section, or in a genteel up-town hotel,
or dwells in a fashionable quarter of the town,
and dresses <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la mode</i>. Nor are her clients by
any means exclusively drawn from among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
lowly and ignorant, as might be supposed, but
more often come from the middle class of
society; and, though consultations are had in
a private manner, those who ply this trade do
so without fear or disguise.</p>

<p>Of the thousand and one matters submitted
to the dictum of fortune-tellers, those relating
to love affairs or money matters are by much
the most numerous. On this head just a few
selections, taken at hazard from the advertising
columns of a morning newspaper, perhaps will
afford the best idea of the nature of the questions
most commonly addressed to these disposers
and dispensers of fate. One reads,
&#8220;Mrs Blank: consult her on all business,
domestic or love affairs. Unites separated
parties.&#8221; A shrewd offer that! The next,
who styles himself &#8220;Doctor&#8221; is an astrologer.
He invites you to send him your sex, with
date and hour of birth; or a full description.
All matters, he naïvely declares, are alike to
him. For the trifling matter of one dollar he
promises &#8220;a full reading&#8221;&mdash;presumably of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
your horoscope. The next, a trance and
business medium, professes to be able to tell
the &#8220;name of future husband or wife, and all
affairs of life.&#8221; Still another, after setting
forth her own abilities in glowing colors, warns
a trusting public, after the manner of all
quacks, to beware of imitators.</p>

<p>As an indication to what extent these forms
of superstition flourish, it would be vastly interesting
to know just how many persons there
are in the United States, for instance, who get
their living by such means. Enough, perhaps,
has been said to open the eyes of even the most
sceptical on this point. We may add that the
modern applicant for foreknowledge is not satisfied
with the obscure generalizations of the
ancient oracles. He or she demands a full and
explicit answer, and will be satisfied with nothing
less.</p>

<p>Moll Pitcher, of Lynn, who practised her art
in the early part of the century, was the most
famous, as she was by far the most successful,
fortune-teller of her day. In fact, her reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
was world-wide, it having been carried to
every port and clime by the masters and sailors,
who never failed to consult her about the luck
of the voyage. Her supposed knowledge of
the future was also much drawn upon by the
highly respectable owners themselves, who, however,
possibly through deference to some secret
qualms, generally made their visits at night,
sometimes in <span class="locked">disguise.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> Indeed, stories little
short of marvellous are told of this cunning
woman&#8217;s skill at divination, or luck at guessing,
according as one may choose to look at the
matter. Besides being the subject of the poet
Whittier&#8217;s least-known verses, a long forgotten
play was written with Moll Pitcher as its
heroine, after the manner of Meg Merrilies, in
Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s &#8220;Guy Mannering.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the earliest to the latest times, the astrologers
have always claimed for their methods
of divination the consideration due to established
principles or incontrovertible facts. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
court astrologer was once quite as much consulted
as the court physician. Though fallen
from this high estate, and even placed under
the ban of the law as a vagabond and charlatan,
the astrologer still continues to ply his trade
among us with more or less success; and, unless
we greatly err, the craft even has an organ,
called not too appropriately, &#8220;The Sphinx,&#8221; as
the Sphinx has never been known to speak,
even in riddles.</p>

<p>Palmistry is the name now given to fortune-telling
by means of the hand alone. Formerly
there was no such distinction. After looking
her client over, the fortune-teller of other days
always based her predictions upon a careful
scrutiny of the hand. Some careless hit-or-miss
reference to the past, at first, such as &#8220;you
have seen trouble,&#8221; usually preceded the unravelling
of the future. The disciples of palmistry
now claim for it something like what was
earlier claimed for phrenology and physiognomy.
Every one knows that palmistry openly
thrives in all large communities as a means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
livelihood. How many practise it in private,
no one can pretend to say, but the number is
certainly very large. It is a further fact that
some surprising guesses at character now and
then occur, but we must hold to the opinion
that they are still only guesses, nothing more.</p>

convict the man of that murder; but yet it is a sufficient occasion
for Magistrates to make a particular inquiry,&#8221; etc.</p></div>
